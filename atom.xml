    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Initially this post was supposed to cover concepts of implementing an example DDD (Domain Driven Design) architecture using F# and Akka.NET. But the more I&rsquo;ve written, the more I&rsquo;ve realized that whole idea won&rsquo;t fit into a single blog post. Therefore I&rsquo;ve decided for now to focus on some basic example covering command/event handlers. To make this more interesting I want to show how Akka.NET and F# features can be used to leverage design established this way.</p>

<h3>Before we begin&hellip;</h3>

<p>I want to notice, that all examples in this post are made mostly to learning purposes. There are some things missing, but I&rsquo;ve decided to leave them since they don&rsquo;t have direct impact on the overall design or current state of the application. If I will continue this thread, I will probably try to extend them and provide some more meaningful context. So please don&rsquo;t treat this code as a real-life reference of DDD implementation.</p>

<p>What is clearly missing in example below? I didn&rsquo;t describe aggregate roots, because boundary context is very simplistic &ndash; to make this post clearer I&rsquo;ve focused more on command-handler-event pattern. Sample doesn&rsquo;t enforce any specific database, using simple dictionary as abstraction. Also it doesn&rsquo;t provide any form of data validation or bindings to existing HTTP server frameworks. They are outside of scope of this post but are very simple to integrate.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Define our domain data structures</h4>

<p>Lets start with domain model. As a boundary context I&rsquo;ve chosen one of the most generic ones &ndash; user account&rsquo;s space. Our simplified business logic in this example will cover two actions &ndash; user registration and sign in. Users will be identified by their email and will use the most basic security features.</p>

<p>But before we move there, lets use some of the features, F# could give us, to shape a type system for our advantage.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">string</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">PasswordHash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="kt">array</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These are examples of type aliases. You may consider using them, if you&rsquo;ve found that usage of some primitive type in given context may be defined as subtype/supertype relation. In this example Email can be considered as a specialization of string &ndash; that means, each email is string, but not each string is a valid email. This kind of granularity can be stretched quite far. Just think about any primary/foreign key field in any entity as it&rsquo;s own unique type. This will automatically disallow mistakes such as assigning keys from entities of incompatible type eg. assigning <code>UserId</code> value to <code>ProductId</code> field! F# expressiveness promotes this behavior.</p>

<p>Now use these types to define our User entity. It&rsquo;s very straightforward:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">phash</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">PasswordHash</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">salt</span>  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="kt">array</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">member</span> <span class="n">empty</span> <span class="o">=</span>  <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">phash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[||];</span> <span class="n">salt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[||]</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next I&rsquo;m going to describe data models for our domain commands and events. It&rsquo;s important to understand purpose of both. Commands are produced to describe tasks to be executed by the system and contains all data necessary to perform it. Events are describing diffs in general application state as a results of performed tasks. What is wort mentioning, events should be described in way, that will allow us to recreate current application state by replaying all events timeline stream. And because events describe changes, that already occurred, they should be immutable by nature &ndash; don&rsquo;t try to change your past if you not wish to mess with your future.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">UserCommand</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">RegisterUser</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">string</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">LoginUser</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">string</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>NOTE: If you want to use F# records to describe your commands/events, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine. I&rsquo;ve chosen discriminated unions for their expressiveness.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">UserEvent</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">UserRegistered</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">salt</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="kt">array</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">phash</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">byte</span> <span class="kt">array</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">timestamp</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">DateTime</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">UserLogged</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">timestamp</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">DateTime</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see there are few things worth of emphasizing:</p>

<ul>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t store user password provided directly from command, using salt + password hash instead. Reason behind is that in DDD events usually could be serialized and stored in some kind of event database. Therefore it&rsquo;s not secure to provide them any sensitive data. However events should contain enough information to give us ability to recreate current database state based on provided stream of events, assuming that it&rsquo;s complete.</li>
<li>Each of our event&rsquo;s contain a timestamp field. Events give us a historical change set of the application. And because they contain only diffs between database states rather than snapshot of entities, they have to be ordered by their creation date. Without it we couldn&rsquo;t recreate them.</li>
</ul>


<p>What other fields may be useful when working with events? Consider attaching current API version number &ndash; this will allow you to endure breaking changes in your code responsible for handling events. Other handy field is unique event id, when you may need functionality associated with generating cascading event chains in response to some other events. In that case having some kind of pointer to originating event may be useful.</p>

<h3>Step 2: describe application behavior in functional manner</h3>

<p>This may be a little controversial statement, but I must say it &ndash; exceptions are bad. They leaves the leaks in your type system and fucks with your application logic flow in the way, that many programmers and almost all compilers cannot understand.</p>

<p>The alternative conception of error handling is old and well-known. It&rsquo;s based on returning error codes. To start with &ndash; if you already know <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, this may look familiar to you:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">&#39;</span><span class="n">ok</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">&#39;</span><span class="n">err</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Ok</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="k">&#39;</span><span class="n">ok</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Error</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="k">&#39;</span><span class="n">err</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You may ask: why the hell do we return error values instead of just throwing exceptions? Are these some archaeological excavations and we&rsquo;re gone back to the C era? Actually no. There is very good reason behind this.</p>

<p>Think about exceptions as a side effects of the application state behavior. You cannot be 100% sure about flow of your application process. Since information about exceptions is not part of any function/method signature, they actually act as a dynamically typed cascading return values anyway &ndash; both compiler and programmers will ignore them until they will occur at runtime.</p>

<p>This time instead of cryptic error codes returned by C, we use F# power to provide type-safe and expressive way for this solution. If you&rsquo;re interested more about interesting ways to utilize return-based error handling using higher-level concepts, I recommend you <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/recipe-part2/">Railway Oriented Programming</a> blogpost and video presented on NDC Oslo 2014. Here, I&rsquo;ll use a greatly simplified version, exposing operator which chain two input functions together and call second one only if result from the first was <code>Ok</code>, and forwarding an <code>Error</code> result otherwise:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">let</span> <span class="o">(&gt;=&gt;)</span> <span class="n">f1</span> <span class="n">f2</span> <span class="n">arg</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">f1</span> <span class="n">arg</span> <span class="k">with</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Ok</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">f2</span> <span class="n">data</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">Error</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nc">Error</span> <span class="n">e</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also decided to use more discriminated unions to describe each specific business logic error in actual bounded context scope. I&rsquo;ve found that returning a string-based messages back to programmers in error logs are not better in any way than creating a specialized error type for each case. The only disadvantage is amount of code you need to write, to declare new type, but again &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a problem with F#.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">type</span> <span class="nc">UserError</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">UserAlreadyExists</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">userEmail</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">UserNotFound</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">userEmail</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">WrongPassword</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">userEmail</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">Email</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">hashedInput</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">PasswordHash</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 3: handle user registration</h3>

<p>How does F# command handling differs from it&rsquo;s more objective oriented counterpart? Since we deal with functional oriented language, most of our logic is composed into functions instead of objects. You&rsquo;ve used to execute your logic with services, here you&rsquo;ve got a function. Wanna some Dependency Injection? Here, you have some currying.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll describe our service as <code>handle</code> function which takes some <code>UserCommand</code> as an input and produces <code>Result&lt;UserEvent, UserError&gt;</code> as output:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">handle</span> <span class="n">clock</span> <span class="n">findUser</span> <span class="n">saveUser</span> <span class="o">=</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nc">RegisterUser</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">match</span> <span class="n">findUser</span> <span class="n">email</span> <span class="k">with</span>

</span><span class='line'>                  <span class="n">salt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">salt</span>
</span><span class='line'>                  <span class="n">phash</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">phash</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="n">saveUser</span> <span class="n">user</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="nc">Ok</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">UserRegistered</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">salt</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">phash</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">clock</span><span class="bp">()</span><span class="o">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you&rsquo;ve seen, this function actually takes 4 parameters (clock, findUser, saveUser and command as implicit argument of calling <strong>function</strong> keyword). But as I&rsquo;ve said, our handle function should take only one input argument. That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ll provide three first arguments through partial function application later &ndash; now you can think about them as constructor arguments injected by your IoC container when resolving new service.</p>

<p>While most of the parameters are quite understandable, one of them may be confusing &ndash; the <code>clock</code> parameter. It&rsquo;s only functionality is to provide current DateTime value. If so, why didn&rsquo;t I just used <code>DateTime.Now</code> directly inside the code? In this example it&rsquo;s actually not so important, but I&rsquo;ve used it to expose simple problem &ndash; things such as date/configuration/environment providers or random number generators could make our handler behavior non-deterministic. That means, if we call this function two times with the same input, we couldn&rsquo;t count on the same output. It&rsquo;s actually problem for logic predictability and in some cases is especially cumbersome when writing tests to verify application behavior. Therefore I think that it&rsquo;s better to separate them as injectable arguments.</p>

<h4>Password hashing and generation</h4>

<p>While you may find some good libraries providing real life hashing features out of hand, I&rsquo;ve decided to leave my example free on unnecessary dependencies and use a standard library instead.</p>

<p>I hope this code doesn&rsquo;t need any explanations.</p>

<h3>Step 4: handle user logging</h3>

<p>Once we already described nuances of the function-based services, this one shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. This case was created to give our example more diversity.</p>

<h3>Step 5: bind your business logic to Akka.NET</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in integrating Akka.NET with your F# logic, I can recommend you more posts in this blog written earlier this year. Therefore I assume, that you&rsquo;re aware how F# actors based on recursive loops work. Because loop creation is often a generic behavior, again I&rsquo;ll expose it in form of function wrapper.</p>

<p>NOTE: At the present moment Akka.NET API for F# language is still lacks some features. This post applies mostly to API in version 0.7 of the framework, so you may expect some changes in the future.</p>

<h4>Mock database access</h4>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve said in the introduction, I won&rsquo;t use any real-life database provider, mocking it with concurrent dictionary instead. However if you want to use a normal database, nothing stands in your way.</p>

<p>F# is heavily function-oriented and this also corresponds to arguments precedence. While in OOP subject (<strong>this</strong>) usually precedes method invocation, in functional languages it&rsquo;s better to use it as last argument of the function. Argumentation for this is currying and partial function application, which allows us to define functions with only part of all necessary arguments provided. The more specific argument, the later it could be applied. Therefore common convention is to provide more detailed parameters at the end of the function parameters list. It&rsquo;s a very useful feature, especially when combined with pipeline operators.</p>

<p>On the other side <code>flip</code> function may be used to reverse parameters precedence in case when, for example, we want to partially apply second argument to the function without providing first one (because it may be yet unknown in this moment). This option will be presented later.</p>

<h4>Handle event subscribers</h4>

<p>One of the nice things in Akka is that it provides a Publish/Subscribe pattern offhand. As an actor-based framework, the only necessary task to do is to subscribe an <code>ActorRef</code> of desired observer directly to Akka system&rsquo;s event stream.</p>

<p>As a lazy person I don&rsquo;t want to be forced to explicitly create new actor each time I want to subscribe some behavior to react for events I&rsquo;ve produced somewhere else. Therefore I&rsquo;ve created simple subscribe helper, which will handle subscriber actor creation for me.</p>

<h3>Bind everything together</h3>

<p>Now when all logic has been defined, it&rsquo;s time to show it in some example code. It will initialize a new Akka system, setup console logging and show features of successful and unsuccessful registering and signing in of the user.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all. Whole example took about 130 lines of F# code to create. I hope this would give you some insights about embedding your business logic into F# function composition model.</p>

<p>PS: If you&rsquo;re interested in more details about DDD and F# programming, at the present moment I can recommend you following other exploring lecture of the other developers, such as Lev Gorodinski (<a href="https://twitter.com/eulerfx">@eulerfx</a>) and his blog for more advanced concepts.</p>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/08/06/fsharp-akkadotnet-supervisors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will describe changes, that will affect a F# API for Akka.NET in the incoming versions of the framework (>= 0.62) &ndash; mostly those, which concerns supervisioning and manipulating actor hierarchies.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to overload this post with explaining what Akka supervision is all about, so I&rsquo;ll just recommend a very good article, which could be found <a href="https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/wiki/Supervision">here</a>.</p>

<p>While previous versions of the Akka F# API introduced some nice features such as function-based actor definitions and creations (<code>spawn</code> function), there still was no simple way to handle some core framework concepts. Remember that march towards Akka.NET 1.0 is still in progress, more and more features are implemented. Therefore it&rsquo;s F# API most likely will also be a subject to change.</p>

<p>To give a better description of the new features, lets see an example:</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/blob/dev/src/examples/FSharp.Api/Supervisioning.fs">whole example</a> is available inside Akka.NET project source code, along with other examples.</p>

<p>Unlike standard <code>spawn</code>, <code>spawns</code> function could take a SupervisorStrategy object as an argument. By using F# API you are able to use <code>Strategy</code> module to quickly create a corresponding strategy instance. It supports two types of strategy creators:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Strategy.oneForOne</code> &ndash; strategy will affect only an exception thrower.</li>
<li><code>Strategy.allForOne</code> &ndash; strategy result will propagate to all children of the actor implementing that strategy.</li>
</ol>


<p>Both functions come in two variants. First one takes only one argument &ndash; <em>decider</em> function, which determines an expected behavior based upon type of exception thrown. Second one (<code>Strategy.oneForOne'</code> and <code>Strategy.allForOne'</code>) precedes decider argument with a timeout and number of possible behavior retries. All of them corresponds directly to standard Akka strategy API, but are wrapped to fit F# functional approach instead of method overrides.</p>

<p>Second change, is the new <code>mailbox.spawn</code> method, which works just like it&rsquo;s standard <code>spawn</code> equivalent with only one difference &ndash; it sets a <code>mailbox</code> Actor instance as current parent/supervisor of created actor. Both of those features combined could be used to bring a full supervision support in classic functional manner.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-02T13:21:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/08/02/simple-vm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I want to present, how to create a simple virtual machine with it&rsquo;s own bytecode interpreter. While it&rsquo;s created using C language, it doesn&rsquo;t use any complex constructs and could be possibly implemented the same with any imperative language.</p>

<p>NOTE: while in this example bytecode instruction set is limited to the simple integer operations, real life virtual machines usually have a lot more complex operands (eg. object creation instruction in VMs with managed memory or dynamic method invocations). Have in mind that even if your Intermediate Representation may look like some BASIC/ASM language, it really could abstract much higher level functionalities.</p>

<h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

<p>Lets start with precising, what our virtual machine should consist of. In this example, we&rsquo;ll create a stack-based virtual machine. What does it mean? There is no notion of registers and all operation are performed through virtual stack. This results in simpler (since our instruction set doesn&rsquo;t have to include virtual registers operations), but also longer bytecode &ndash; because of more operations have to be executed than in alternative option, which may support a virtual register calls.</p>

<p>In this example, our virtual machine will consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Executable code pointer</strong> &ndash; in order to execute the program, a VM has to now what program it is ;) Our bytecode contains opcodes (which are integers used to define instructions to be executed by an interpreter) and numbers used for things such as constant values, memory addresses or stack offsets.</li>
<li><strong>Stack</strong> &ndash; virtual stack will work as fragment of memory used for storing intermediate results and additional data of each instruction. When a procedure call will be invoked, it will also save a state of the program at moment, when procedure has been called, to retrieve it back after program will return from that call.</li>
<li><strong>Local data</strong> &ndash; unlike the stack, which uses LIFO (Last-In First-Out) operations, local data may be used as random access memory. It also may change it&rsquo;s size according to program needs. In this example we may use it to store both global and local variables.</li>
<li><strong>Program counter</strong> &ndash; it contains an address of currently executed instruction. Program will be executed by moving PC through instruction set, reading opcodes and executing them.</li>
<li><strong>Stack pointer</strong> &ndash; it contains information about number of elements stored on the stack. It always points on the top of it.</li>
<li><strong>Frame pointer</strong> &ndash; since we need to differentiate a locally and globally scoped values (this includes function arguments), we need to know where our scope is located on the stack. All local variables are assigned relatively to FP position.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bytecode instruction set</h3>

<p>At the begginig we&rsquo;ll start from defining a set of instructions to be handled by our language. For sake of simplicity we&rsquo;ll focus on basic integer operations, printing their result, variable creation and procedure-oriented calls.</p>

<p>Just like in standard assembly code, each instruction is represented by specific byte number. In more realistic virtual machine those numbers may have specific values (for example to perform bitwise masking).</p>

<h3>Main interpreter loop</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to create our code execution loop. How does it work? It&rsquo;s a simple loop with switch statement used to interpret particular operation codes found in our program. While this is not the fastest solution, it gives us a simple understanding of how fetch/decode/execute cycle works.</p>

<p>Here we&rsquo;ve already defined <code>HALT</code>, <code>POP</code> and <code>PRINT</code> opcodes. In more realistic example, you probably don&rsquo;t want to define value display in form of dedicated instruction, but this will allow us to simply see result of our operations.</p>

<h3>Integer operators</h3>

<p>Now we can define some integer operations. While we&rsquo;re defined a plenty of them, here I&rsquo;ll show only one example for each group: constant initialization, arithmetic and logic operations.</p>

<p>What is worth emphasizing, is that all value swaps are performed through stack (there are no registers), so each instruction takes it&rsquo;s operands from top of the stack and also puts a computed result on top of it. Also, since stacks are LIFO-type collections, all values taken from the stack are in reversed order &ndash; for example look at <code>ADD_I32</code> instruction below.</p>

<p>Instructions such as <code>SUB_I32</code>, <code>MUL_I32</code> and <code>EQ_I32</code> won&rsquo;t be defined in scope of this post, but I think when you&rsquo;ll understand example above, they should be easy to implement.</p>

<h3>Jump instructions</h3>

<p>Next, we have to define jump instructions in our code. They are basically equivalent of <code>goto</code> keyword and may be used to implement statements such as loops and if/else conditions.</p>

<p>Again, <code>JUMPF</code> (conditional jump if false) implementation should be analogous to <code>JMPT</code>.</p>

<h3>Move memory globally</h3>

<p>Now, when all basic constructs are defined, we shall provide a way to define a variables in our program. This paragraph will cover problem of globally-scoped ones, while the next one will show how to implement locally-scoped variables.</p>

<p>Unlike stack, a local data is a random access memory of elastic size, so all in/out operations performed on it using memory addresses (aka. pointers). Therefore in our example all load/store opcodes should be followed by number being an address pointer to the local data.</p>

<h3>Manipulate local scope memory</h3>

<p>This is similar to previously defined <code>GLOAD</code> and <code>GSTORE</code> instruction. However there is a one significant difference &ndash; instead of taking an locals address directly from provided value, we compute it relatively to current frame pointer.</p>

<h3>Procedure calls</h3>

<p>All of previous instructions were fairly simple to execute. Now it&rsquo;s time to do something slightly more complex &ndash; function/procedure calls. Before we begin, lets describe how they works. To perform the call, we have to first save the current state of the program at the moment before the call will be performed &ndash; it will let us freely alter program state in scope of the function. To do so, we have to save three values:</p>

<ul>
<li>Address of the caller instruction &ndash; this is a current value of program counter and it&rsquo;s need to be stored, so that VM will know, where program should return from finished procedure call.</li>
<li>Frame pointer &ndash; this is necessary, since we want to be able to use locally scoped variables when we enter into new procedure (<strong>tl;dr</strong> &ndash; it gives us a function scope feature).</li>
<li>Number of function/procedure arguments &ndash; before call will be performed, all necessary arguments will be put on top of the stack. However returning from function should dispose all of the provided arguments, so that we could retrieve back state of the stack from before the function call. If we want to know how many arguments from the stack should be thrown away, firstly we have to store that count &ndash; it will be also put on top of the stack.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>RET</code> instruction works in reverse order &ndash; it takes value from top of the stack as function return value, rollbacks frame pointers, moves program counter to the caller instruction, disposes all of function call arguments from the stack and replaces all of these with return value.</p>

<p>Because we&rsquo;ve stored all of those values on top of the stack, we&rsquo;re able to store next consecutive calls in the same manner. It means that, we&rsquo;re able to nest our procedure calls. However, since each call stores some portion of data on the stack, at some point we may run out of memory, which cause stack overflow error.</p>

<p>As you may have seen, there is a lot of <code>LOAD, -3</code> operations. Why -3? Again, when we perform a procedure call, we need to store current program state on top of the stack. To do so, we&rsquo;ll put here a 3 values: program counter (as return address), frame pointers before the call, and number of arguments to be used by called procedure. Therefore everything below them (-3 and less) will be an actual function arguments saved on the stack. You could optimize it by adding something like <code>LDARG, x</code> opcode.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>There are numerous reasons, why developers may want to use intermediate bytecode representations for their languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> &ndash; as you&rsquo;ve seen, execution of the bytecode is realized mostly by just moving (mostly incrementing) PC pointer. When interpreter works directly by evaluating and traversing an AST tree, there is a lot of pointer jumping and structure blocks, which is slightly more complex and slower. Bytecode allows you to faster code interpretation as well as it may facilitate some optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>Code size</strong> &ndash; full code operates on human readable strings, which may consume some memory and are harder to interpret. Intermediate program representation uses only a simple integer arrays.</li>
<li><strong>Well-fitting</strong> &ndash; since you may describe your own IR, you may fit it directly to your needs. It&rsquo;s easier to parse, and it could remove some repetitive work, when you&rsquo;ll want to implement your language on the various OSes.</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2014-07-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/07/09/fsharp-akka-map-reduce</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post, I&rsquo;ve shown how to create a simple <em>hello world</em> application using Akka.net system leveraged with a F# API. Today, I&rsquo;ll show a slightly more complex example. We&rsquo;ll create a simple Map-Reduce system based on distributed word count algorithm.</p>

<p>Idea of our algorithm is quite simple &ndash; we want to group and count all repetitions of the same words (case-insensitive) in input text. This is a perfect subject to illustrate a map-reduce algorithm as well as Akka.net task distribution mechanism. To realize our objective, we&rsquo;ll need to define three actor types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master &ndash; it&rsquo;s main job is to spread an input data equally among other actors and forward request for result data.</li>
<li>Mappers &ndash; they will tokenize their text fragments into specific words and send it to reducers.</li>
<li>Reducers &ndash; they are responsible for word grouping and counting.</li>
</ul>


<p>At the beginning, lets define basic message types used by our system:</p>

<ul>
<li>One to propagate chunks of data to mapping nodes.</li>
<li>Next one to forward processed data to reducers.</li>
<li>Last one to invoke collection mechanism, which will concatenate all reduced data to one peace and send it back to the originator.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of them are illustrated by the code below:</p>

<p>As you may have seen previously, instead of C#/Scala objective approach, I&rsquo;ve used tail-recursive function to define an actor processing routine. Since a lot of it&rsquo;s code would be repetitive among all of the actor types we want to define, I&rsquo;ve created a simple function factory, which will wrap all varying logic for us.</p>

<p>Lets start to defining a map-reduce logic into our application. Firstly we need to create a <strong>map actor</strong>. In this example, all what it needs to do, is to chop provided string into single words, and create from them a simple bag of words with their repetition. However we won&rsquo;t sum them now &ndash; this is the job for reducer actors.</p>

<p>As you may see, after finishing it&rsquo;s work, mapper will send list of words directly to reducers. To make this possible, we need to provide reducer reference as one of the function parameters.</p>

<p>Next type is the <strong>reduce actor</strong>. It&rsquo;s task is to group all incoming words, and count their occurrences. In our example we use shared <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code> for gathering data from all of the reducer instances. For more real life example, we should probably use some more sophisticated mechanism, such as <strong>aggregate actor</strong> concatenating all results provided by specific reducers. Here for sake of simplicity, we omit it.</p>

<p>Since reducer actors have direct access to shared dictionary, they also are able to respond on Collect command, providing all reduced data back to message sender.</p>

<p>The last behavior, is the <strong>master actor</strong>. It&rsquo;s role is to be a proxy between application&rsquo;s in/out data, and the rest of the actors. We use it for two tasks: 1) sending text line by line to be processed by our Map-Reduce application, 2) forwarding request for result of MR operation.</p>

<p>Now when we have all of our actors defined, we may initialize an Akka framework to create our MR system. Now we can use a helper functions, we&rsquo;ve defined before for fast and easy actor definition.</p>

<p>To finalize, we can pass some data to our system to see, if it returns an expected results. Until now, we&rsquo;ve only used send operator <code>&lt;!</code> to delegate fire-and-forget messages for specific actors, but we&rsquo;ve actually never used any two way request-response mechanism. To do so, we&rsquo;ll use Ask method (shortcut operator <code>&lt;?</code>) to send a request message and receive a handler to be used when a response will be returned in asynchronous manner.</p>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/07/05/fsharp-akka-net</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Actor model is one of the most influential paradigms of dealing with highly concurrent environments in present world. Simplifying, it&rsquo;s based on concept of autonomous thread-safe computation units &ndash; surprisingly called actors &ndash; with no way to directly interfere with each others work. There are no locks or semaphores &ndash; instead of accessing shared resources, they are simply passing messages around &ndash; according to the saying <em>Don&rsquo;t communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating</em>.</p>

<p>The first most widespread usage of the actor model was the Erlang Virtual Machine in 1986. While it was for many years closed in it&rsquo;s own niche, programming model itself has been lately forwarded and adopted on the Java Virtual Machine through <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> framework. Until present moment there are actually none mature equivalents on .NET platform. While Microsoft is still developing it&rsquo;s own response in form of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orleans/">Project Orleans</a>, a bunch of developers took the initiative of porting Akka on .NET ground.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to try out Akka.NET a little. I&rsquo;ve noticed that it&rsquo;s still a far from completion or production-ready phase, but hopefully since it&rsquo;s based on already existing and mature framework, with help of OSS community missing holes could be patched soon.</p>

<h2>Hello Akka</h2>

<p>You can find an original first step into Akka.NET with F# API <a href="https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/wiki/FSharp-API">here</a>. While I found this sample useful, I&rsquo;ve decided to investigate more about Akka.NET source code and it&rsquo;s F# API. Below you may see my example based on more functional-specific concepts:</p>

<p>Here are some explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>We defined a discriminated union of messages <code>ActorMsg</code>, we want to respond to.</li>
<li>The next step is to create an <code>ActorSystem</code>, analogously to C# and original Scala versions.</li>
<li>We need to define and instantiate an <code>Actor</code>. However unlike the object approach &ndash; which required a custom actor type inheriting from one of the Akka actor classes and defining it&rsquo;s own receiving method &ndash; here we define a tail recursive function, which uses an <code>actor { ... }</code> computation expression instead of actor type declaration.</li>
<li>We pass that function through the lambda to <code>spawn</code> method, which attaches that behavior to our system and returns an <code>ActorRef</code> (not to be confused with Actor instance), assigned to our <code>greeter</code> variable. This way we may refer to actors, and pass messages to them, even if they&rsquo;re not present on our local machine (which is also one of the Akka use cases).</li>
<li>Last two lines are about sending messages to actor references using send operator <code>&lt;!</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, this piece of code is not directly translatable to C# or even Scala API equivalent. It&rsquo;s much more Erlangish. We don&rsquo;t have to define any classes and method overrides. Instead, we have a tail-recursive function. For me this seems more natural approach for F#, since it&rsquo;s more functional-first language, while it&rsquo;s syntax for object oriented programming is very verbose and ugly.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-03T00:05:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/07/03/fsharp-and-scala-absent-values</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Handling an absent values is one of the most common problems in programming languages. Why we consider this so important? It&rsquo;s because data processing is essential task of every program ever made. And one of the main reasons of systems errors and undefined behaviors are values not present in the system. Most of the modern programming languages tries to aim programmers with solution to handle those cases. Lets look at the most common way of dealing with them:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Null pointer reference</strong> &ndash; also called a &ldquo;billion-dollar mistake&rdquo;, introduced by Tony Hoare. It allows to represent an absence of the heap allocated values (objects) in form of pointer referring to not a valid instance of represented type. In most of the mainstream programming languages all heap objects are nullable by default &ndash; no matter if you want it or not.</li>
<li><strong>Option/Maybe type</strong> &ndash; this approach is characteristic for most of the functional languages. Instead of creating null pointer, it defines a special generic type (eg. Option), represented by either one of it&rsquo;s subtypes (Some as wrapper for existing underlying value, or None if value is not present).</li>
</ol>


<p>So why we consider a dedicated Option type a better solution? Because it&rsquo;s explicit, propagates type information about value nullability and &ndash; most of all &ndash; it&rsquo;s non-default. By the most of the time, we expect to have a meaningful references to our data. Their absence is not a desired and certainly should not be an expected behavior. Problem in nullable references is that literally any instance in our code could represent a non-existing value. Analogously to functional approach, all of our objects always represent an Option type.</p>

<p>Currently, after decades on living in shadows, functional paradigm is gaining more and more ground of the field of mainstream programming languages. This also reflects in two of the most popular programming environments, JVM and .NET. Their functional representatives, Scala and F#, claims to combine best of both programming paradigms. This way they also introduced and popularized an Option types among object oriented approach.</p>

<p>But something has been missed along the way, and (in my opinion) both Scala and F# had failed in face of the problem of value absence. Why? Because of their dualism. Since they are functional languages, both of them allows you to create an Option types with full support expected from a functional language. But while they also are object oriented and built on top of object oriented VMs, they allow you to use and create a nullable references. This leads to false sense of security, when using Option types. Lets look at the following example (F#):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='fsharp'><span class='line'><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">option</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Some</span> <span class="n">doSmthAndReturnString</span><span class="bp">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>How can you be sure that function <code>doSmthAndReturnString</code> won&rsquo;t return a null? Actually you can&rsquo;t until you perform an explicit null check. From the runtime perspective <code>Some null</code> is a perfectly valid record. Does it sound rational? No. So why is this even possible?</p>

<h2>How to combine functional and object oriented worlds?</h2>

<p>From my perspective, the best solution of that problem came with <a href="http://ceylon-lang.org/">Ceylon</a> language. It&rsquo;s based on the concept of <a href="http://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.0/tour/types/#union_types">Union Types</a>, one of the key features of Ceylon. For <strong>tl;dr</strong> people &ndash; union type of <code>X|Y</code> is a supertype of both types <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. How does it correspond to null/options?</p>

<p>In Ceylon <code>null</code> have it&rsquo;s own unique type <code>Null</code> (just like in Scala). By default all reference types are non-nullable (similarly to functional languages). However they may be nulled if referenced as union type of <code>T|Null</code> (or <code>T?</code> using some syntax suggar). This concept is basically &ndash; however not entirely &ndash; equivalent of Scala <code>Either[T,Null]</code> but without verbose requirement for object wrapping. Moreover, Ceylon compiler is able to optimize this away to standard JVM null references, without any overhead.</p>

<p>As you can see on the example above, this way we combined advantages of safe, explicitly nullable types with verbosity and performance of null referenced types. In my opinion this is a proper, yet still not widespread, solution of one of the most common problem in languages theory.</p>

<p>As you remember, one of the well known side effects of stack-allocated values is that they&rsquo;re destroyed automatically, when we leave scope, where they were created. This remains true in .NET environment &ndash; it assures that no more but one value or pointer may be found on top of the stack when returning from method execution.</p>

<p>But what happens, when we execute <code>Example1</code> method and then call lambda returned? <code>a</code> variable as stack allocated structure, should be already destroyed at that moment (it&rsquo;s out of it&rsquo;s creation scope and has not been returned explicitly). But that&rsquo;s not what really happens. Actually .NET environment performs an <strong>escape analysis</strong> to determine if any references to that structure didn&rsquo;t leave it&rsquo;s scope. In that case it would be rather heap allocated in order to prevent premature destruction.</p>

<p>Other known case, when structs become heap allocated values, are allocations of large amounts of memory dedicated to handle values. Since stack memory is very limited (by default it&rsquo;s about 1MB per thread on Windows OS), massive structure allocations would potentially cause a StackOverflowException. What .NET environment does in that case, is fallback to safer heap-based allocations.</p>

<p><em>NOTE</em>: Unfortunatelly at the present moment C# doesn&rsquo;t provide escape analysis to determine if class instances could be stack allocated. Java, even though hasn&rsquo;t got custom value types yet, can provide that feature for specific conditions.</p>

<h1>Struct and class method calls differs significantly</h1>

<p>Next exercise. Think about two types, struct and a class. Both of them have non-static method with identical signature and implementation. When you create instances of both types and call mentioned methods, which call will be faster? If you&rsquo;d thought, that struct method call will be slightly faster, you&rsquo;re right. But why?</p>

<p>Answer lies in low level difference between CIL instructions <code>call</code> and <code>callvirt</code>. Standard class methods use <code>callvirt</code> (name is misleading &ndash; it&rsquo;s used even for non-virtual methods). Since CLR cannot absolutely guarantee, if instance method is overridden or shadowed, it has to perform explicit check by seeking class VTable for function pointer. Actual VTable pointer is one of the internal members of each object. Therefore it requires null check to be performed.</p>

<p>Since struct cannot be null, we don&rsquo;t have to perform null checking. However it&rsquo;s not necessary. Since value types cannot declare or override virtual methods &ndash; struct have fixed inheritance chain &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have to access their VTables. Actually lack of inheritance is so useful, that structure instances don&rsquo;t need to have any pointers to VTable at all. All of these save time necessary to perform a method call.</p>

<p>From that perspective struct method calls are much closer to static methods &ndash; also invoked through <code>call</code> instruction &ndash; than instantiated ones.</p>

    <updated>2014-02-20T22:47:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/02/20/more-thoughts-on-knockout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I want to share with my reflections on using <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> and client side MVVM pattern. Some of them refer to my previous post on the same <a href="http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/03/09/knockoutjs-spostrzezenia/">topic</a> (in Polish language). These are my advices to all entusiasts of JavaScipt rich applications, especially to those, who want to try Knockout in production environment.</p>

<h1>Layered structure</h1>

<p>Most of the frontent application logic, I&rsquo;ve got an occasion to look into, was pretty messy. Simple web pages usually are build of chunks of JavaScript code used to bound existing libraries and perform simple logic tasks. Everything is coupled, any kind of logic and DOM manipulations are mixed together. This is the place, where unicorns live and magic happens. But if you&rsquo;re into rich client side applications and frameworks such as Knockout.js, this is not an option. Why?</p>

<p>Knockout.js, AngularJS, Backbone and other MV* frameworks are dedicated to create a web applications. This literaly means, that your client page is an application rather than an ordinary page, rendered only to display the data. There will be probably a <strong>lot</strong> of code and logic bound to HTML on the page. If you will manage your code in unstructurized manner, you&rsquo;ll soon find yourself in spot, where any further changes will the a depressing, time-consuming nightmare.</p>

<p>To be able to manage a large chunks of code, you will need to decouple your JavaScript logic into layers. Beacuse Knockout doesn&rsquo;t provide any application layers off hand, responsibility of creating them lies on you. In rest of the post bellow I want to share my personal experiences developed during many months spent of using Knockout in production environment. Layers described by me can be exactly mapped onto specific patterns/groups of patterns and are described from top to bottom, beginning from layer used for server communication, through data management, HTML page partitioning to core used to bound everything together.</p>

<h2>Gateway</h2>

<p>The main goal of the Gateway object is to abstract server API to look like an ordinary JavaScript function. We would like to call the service in form of <code>usersApi.getUserById(1)</code> rather than cryptic <code>$.post(''api/users', { id: 1 })</code>. In my opinion this is more natural and gives us an easier way for further refactoring. What else can gateways do?</p>

<p>First of all, they should be able to hide necessity of resolution parametrized URLs from view models. They should be able to resolve them or have some helpers attached (think about eqivalent of UrlHelpers, path methods etc.).</p>

<p>In most of the cases I&rsquo;ve met, server communication is done by traditional ajax requests through jQuery ajax or similar calls. Since those functions always returns jQuery promises as a result, you may find that this is not what you want. Maybe you need a more detailed informations or a custom wrapper around promises. Or if you use <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">RxJS</a>, you probably may want <code>Rx.Observable</code> objects. For all of these cases Gateway is good place to implement.</p>

<p>Gateways could be also used to perform mapping of JSON into fully qualified JavaScript objects you may want to use. This includes things like serializing/deserializing dates, adding additional computed properties, adding/removing recursive dependencies or even changing entire structure of object to beter fit our needs. From Knockout point of view, we can wrap/unwrap objects into ko.observables directly at this layer.</p>

<p>When your data manipulation and mapping logic become more and more complex, consider using a dedicated Factory/Mapper objects to maintain code decoupling.</p>

<h2>Data source</h2>

<p>Data sources (or Data Access Objects) are alternatives to gateways, since they serve similar purpose, but provide much more complex mechanisms. When we speak about data represented on the page, we&rsquo;ll probably see problems associated with incomplete data representation on client side. Paginated tables, autocomplete suggestions, calendar pages, infinite scrolls etc. When used with remote source, all of these use server side requests to get data to be shown to end users. But on large data volumes we never retrieve all of the informations, instead using only those records, which need te be displayed. One of the roles of data sources is to store and manage data received this way, so the next time user goes back to previously displayed page or gets subset of records already provided, we may restore it from the local cache rather than repeating request to the server.</p>

<p>If you want to see a possible ways to implement this pattern, I would recommend you to look at some of the existing implementations, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/bloodhound.md">Bloodhound</a> suggestion engine for Twitter&rsquo;s <a href="http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/">typeahead.js</a> library</li>
<li>Kendo UI <a href="http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/framework/datasource">DataSource</a> prototype</li>
<li><a href="http://www.breezejs.com/">Breeze.js</a> framework</li>
<li><a href="http://pouchdb.com/">PouchDB</a>, which is actually full in-browser database with remote sync option</li>
</ul>


<p>All of them provide interesting point of view of what separated data source managers are capable to.</p>

<p>Among other advantages of data source separation we could mention sharing of common data between view models, which should not reference too each other directly, but also managing data objects lifecycle. Fetching data from the server, and synchronizing changes made localy by the client could be done easily this way.</p>

<p>When it comes to data objects, I&rsquo;ve noticed that for purposes of data manipulation on the client side it&rsquo;s nice to have some kind of universal identifiers to manipulate enities. Those identifiers should uniquely identify single entity among all others on the page &ndash; this means, that database identifiers from the JSON object representing server side entities may not be sufficient, since in many cases the records id&rsquo;s (at least when we speak about relational databases with non-UUID primary keys) are guaranted to be unique only in single table/collection scope.</p>

<p>In my case good solution of this problem seems to be an additional object property &ndash; lets call it <code>$id</code> &ndash; which serves only client side logic (server may ignore that value) and it&rsquo;s combination of unique identifier of the entity type and single entity identifier. Since it&rsquo;s called the same among all data objects in client side application, no matter of their type, we may also definie universal comparison operators and function for fetching and data integration. To do so it&rsquo;s also necessary that <code>$id</code> has to be generated in deterministic way &ndash; no matter how many times we create a JavaScript representation of the same database record, it should allways have the same <code>$id</code> value.</p>

<h2>Partial View Models</h2>

<p>Partial view models are used to separate model-view binding in domains of interests. Instead of unorganized bindings of all observed properties to single God Object, remember to use smaller pieces which actually fits a concrete parts of your page &ndash; menus, navbars, forms, modal windows etc.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ever mix a multiple view models in scope of single view component. The only exception from that rule is when you need to manipulate current view model in it&rsquo;s parent context, but even in that case you shouldn&rsquo;t access higher than direct parrent of current VM. If you do, that usually means, something is wrong.</p>

<p>Avoid referencing between view models, especially when they share the same hierarchy level. View models should be an independent units of work. They don&rsquo;t need to know details of other view models to perform requested operations. Use Knockout contexts or dedicated objects as an inter-communication layer and share them between view models, when some message passing is needed.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t create large nested objects inside view models. Inject them through constructors instead. Knockout view models lifetime is much longer than AngularJS controllers, but it&rsquo;s still a better solution to share large objects and &ndash; if they come with a lot of logic &ndash; to decouple them from view model. This also includes objects used to communicate with external world.</p>

<h2>Application root</h2>

<p>Since Knockout allows you to use only one View Model as root for whole page, my advice is to create dedicated view model, which won&rsquo;t be used with any visible parts of the page itself. It&rsquo;s role is to serve as a container for actual view models used to display data on the page and to provide universal features to be used by everyone. For me this option remains true even for small ingerention of Knockout logic into the page, because in the world of changing requirements formally small pages may grow rapidly in very short amount of time.</p>

<p>When comes to integration of partial view models and application root, usually it&rsquo;s sufficient to create <strong>all</strong> partial VMs on root level. View models can be nested in large tree structures, but don&rsquo;t overuse this feature. Try to keep your view models dependency scopes as flat as you can. Application root is a good point to handle inner components creation and lifecycle. That also means, it should be able to access and provide all objects &ndash; gateways, data sources, factories, event buses, AJAX handlers etc. &ndash; directly to view models.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Events and Pub/Sub pattern</h2>

<p>There are few more things I wish to present in this post. One of them is a Publish/Subscribe pattern and event processing. It isn&rsquo;t bound to any specific layer since all of them can get advantage of using it. I also found it the best way of dealing with communication between various Knockout view models.</p>

<p>Below I will show one of the simplest implementation used to handling custom events. If you want to be able to use more advanced techniques, you probably want to look for some dedicated libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">RxJS</a>.</p>

<p>Since we have whole event pub/sub feature in one separate prototype, we can now implement it in any object we wish, either through composition or as a mixin. Additionaly we can use globaly shared instances of <code>EventStream</code> in similar fashion we use an event buses. For Knockout applications there is also an alternative in form of <a href="https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-postbox">knockout-postbox</a>.</p>

<h1>Final thoughs</h1>

<p>I want to end with a few short advices:</p>

<ul>
<li>All of my observations are based on observations of using Knockout and MVVM in non-SPA paradigm. As I&rsquo;ve said in previous posts, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend Knockout for creating single page applications, because there are a lot of alternative frameworks, which suits better for this purpose.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/Knockout-Validation">Knockout-validation</a> library &ndash; I&rsquo;ve found it pain in the ass almost everytime, I&rsquo;ve needed to create anything more complex than basic, flat structure validation. There are a lots of problems when it comes to nested objects validation, nullable objects and dealing with validation results caches &ndash; which btw. cannot be accessed via library API. So if you are determined to use it, consider yourself warned.</li>
<li>Use unit tests any time you can. This not only will allow you to catch more potential errors (which are more likely to exist in language such as JavaScript) but are also a nice way to check if your code blocks are properly separated. And better prepare yourself, because client side logic tests are much more difficult to write than their backend cousins.</li>
<li>Create a common prefix for properties used as helper fields and methods, but not directly responsible for view model page manipulations. I&rsquo;ve already shown examples such as <code>$id</code> field and event stream methods with <code>$</code> prefix. I&rsquo;ve found them quite usefull, but I don&rsquo;t want refer to them from view <code>data-bind</code> attributes or server side. They should remain transparent for both of these.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t mention about any kind of Service layer, used for performin business logic. The reason is simple &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re creating SPA with offline editing capabilities, due to reliability and security reasons you probably never wan&rsquo;t to inject a business logic into frontend.</li>
</ul>


<p>And last but not least. There are no universal rules. Form your own point of view, appropriate to your problems.</p>

    <link href="http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/02/02/uncommon-static-type-feats/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-02T15:29:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/02/02/uncommon-static-type-feats</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this post I want to focus on features of statically typed languages which I consider interesting and usefull, but still uncommon and rare among most popular ones in dev environment. First of all, lets try to answer the question: why static typing? We need to realize, what advantages of static typing do we embrace, so we can look for further improvements.</p>

<ol>
<li>Performance &ndash; of course this is first notable difference. Since static typing gives a compiler much more informations about generated program, we have both much heavier optimizations that could be done at compile time and less need of type checking at runtime.</li>
<li>Better tooling &ndash; if our compiler can reason more about our code, so do other tools we use in application development.</li>
<li>Program correctness &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have to be constantly aware of all application functionalities. Because we have expert system in the form of a compiler, we can maintain larger code bases.</li>
</ol>


<p>In scope of this post I want to notice possible features, which may enhance both programmer productivity, application logic correctness and overal code design.</p>

<h2>Type unions and intersections</h2>

<p>Languages: <a href="http://ceylon-lang.org/">Ceylon</a></p>

<p>This feature gives us a profit of union and intersection operations as we know them in set theory, and apply them to types in our language. Type and set theories are very closely related, and they both can benefit with many of common theorems (for example: roots of Hindley-Milner type inference lies in set theory).</p>

<p>Type unions seems to be more natural way to represent some relations, than inheritance. Example: think about type, which could represent all numbers, lets call it <code>Number</code>. From type theory it looks like the best fit would be (literally) union of integer and floating point numbers, which give us a representiation of most of the domain. If this isn&rsquo;t sufficient, it&rsquo;s even easier to extend our Number type with union of more than two types. Now try to do it only by using inheritance or composition&hellip;</p>

<p>Type unions allows us to do the most important thing, most of the non-functional languages do wrong &ndash; proper null handling. In Ceylon <code>Null</code> have it&rsquo;s own type (however it&rsquo;s optimized away during compilation) and is subject to all mentioned rules. All reference variables and field are non-nullable by default &ndash; thanks to unions this behavior could be changed by using notation <code>T|Null</code> or it&rsquo;s simplified form <code>T?</code> for variable type declaration. It&rsquo;s actually a good thing, since this is what we expect from variables in our code for 90% of the time. So why we have to code in continous risk of null exceptions (unless we perform explicit checking), if we may tell compiler to ensure that for us before our code even run? On the other hand, there are a nullable value types, which are also quite usefull at some times. Many languages allow us to use some kind of built-in nullable wrappers, sorrounded with specific compiler magic for programmer convinience (eg. C#). But in my opinion this is not the right way of doing things. If compiler is allowed to use some nice tricks, then we as the programmers also should be able to do so.</p>

<h2>Type constraints / Value dependent types</h2>

<p>Languages: Ada, Eiffel, (experimentally through extensions) all ML-familly languages including Haskell, F*, <a href="http://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a></p>

<p>Since we already have a unions and intersections, it would be nice to allow other operations to be performed directly on types. What about conditions?</p>

<p>Lets say I&rsquo;ve got an <code>int</code> type, so I could verify at compile time, that all of the necessary values are restricted to be integers. Ok. Lets go further. What if I want to narrow those integers to omit negative numbers? Actually this is still easy in most of the languages (Java, you have one job&hellip;), since they already have some kind of <code>unsigned int</code> type. But what when I want to go a step further: I want to ensure that my integers are only positive numbers, that means they&rsquo;re neither negatives nor 0. It should be easy, but it&rsquo;s not. Almost all of the languages fail at that moment, requiring programmer to manually check that condition through code at runtime. And this is where type constraints comes to play.</p>

<p>They allow programmer to define specific constraints on values, they refer to. Let me precise this on some pseudocode examples:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>type Positive = x:int where x &gt; 0
</span><span class='line'>type Even = x:int where x % 2 == 0
</span><span class='line'>type IPv4 = x:unsigned byte[] where x.Length == 4</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So why I consider this nice and usefull? Some languages (eg. C/C++, Go) already offers fixed length arrays, while equivalent the example <code>Even</code> type could be created as specialized class? First of all it&rsquo;s easier, since you have one way to solve multiple problems. It also could be implemented fast (think about implementing and working with custom Even class in language such as Java), which makes it more likely to be used in real life. Next, it&rsquo;s all available at compiler level, when you can actually verify your code before running it and allow compiler for further optimizations. They also could be potentialy empovered when used with type set-like operations described in previous paragraph. And finally refinement types could also be used for implementing Design by Contract principles in your code, which by itself is a nice feature.</p>

<h2>Implicit interfaces</h2>

<p>Languages: <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a></p>

<p>This one is quite controversial, especially when compared to previously mentioned features. There are many programmers considering implicit interfaces as potentially unsafe, for example by weakening type safety in static typing by creating risk of accidential interface implementation. There are many examples provided to support this thesis, but actually I found most of them is result of bad design decision and broken conventions, or simply explicit interfaces are not solution to presented problems either.</p>

<p>So in what cases implicit interfaces could be usefull:</p>

<ol>
<li>Just like in case of monkey patching it&rsquo;s a way to provide additional features to existing types, that we have no access to. This may be especially usefull to patching holes in stdlib implementations (no matter how hard you try, you never foresee all of them). Example: lack of IParseable interface in .NET common lib.</li>
<li>It makes easier to work with various external libs, minimazing need of constructing adapters to bypass incompatibilities.</li>
<li>It also makes very simple to create mocks.</li>
</ol>


<p>They also encourage some good practices when working with interfaces. Since they&rsquo;re implicit, you will naturally try to keep them as simple and decoupled as possible. It&rsquo;s easy to maintain implementation of interface having dozens of methods, when they are explicit, it&rsquo;s harder to do so in implicit way. And since the purpose of interface is to abstract and describe contract between parts of your application, interfaces with numerous methods are often symphoms of a God Objects in your code. On the other hand it&rsquo;s easier to create a class implementing dozens of interfaces, when they&rsquo;re implicit rather than explicit. This also promotes decoupling.</p>

<h2>Great absent</h2>

<p>Actually I didn&rsquo;t mentioned some of most core features, which benefit all statically typed languages, such as types as first-class citizens, type inference or language macros/templates. The reason of this is, that those thing are well known and more or less present in many of the popular languages we have today. My goal was to describe some potential advantages of powerfull, yet less known features we may see with hope they would be more often met and used in the future.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-12T23:03:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2014/01/12/przenosiny</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Od ostatniego posta minęło trochę czasu, było to jednak związane z ambitnymi zmianami jakie od dawna planowałem wobec bloga. <a href="http://horusiath.blogspot.com">Mój poprzedni blog</a> naprawdę dawał się już we znaki, głównie przez rozrośnięty i archaiczny silnik, który sprawiał naprawdę sporo kłopotów kiedy przychodziło do odrobiny bardziej zaawansowanej konfiguracji.</p>

<p>Chciałem zamienić swojego bloga w coś prostego w obsłudze, a jednocześnie dającego możliwości sporej personalizacji. Po drodze szukałem różnych rozwiązań. W praktyce wziąłem pod uwagę 3 z nich:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wordpress &ndash; ta opcja odpadła relatywnie szybko, z podobnych przyczyn dla jakich nie lubiłem bloggera. Dodatkowym argumentem były znalezione w Internecie opinie innych programistów, którzy określali WP jako silnik zbyt rozdmuchany względem swoich nowszych konkurentów.</li>
<li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> &ndash; początkowo był to dość poważny kandydat. Projekt ufundowany przez Kickstarter, w momencie kiedy zwróciłem na niego swoją uwagę, dobijał właśnie wersji 0.3.3. Oparty o platformę node.js, z dość aktywną społecznością jak na tak młode środowisko, gotowym forum dla szukających pomocy oraz kilkoma drobniejszymi smaczkami, jak chociażby obsługą Markdown jako domyślnego formatu pisania postów &ndash; którego to i tak używam przy codziennym pisaniu dokumentów. Niestety we znaki dała się znać jego niedojżałość, zwłaszcza w momencie, gdy musiałem wykorzystać inne niż domyślna kompozycje, dorzucić kilka własnych skryptów, czy postawić całość na <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> (bo właśnie takiego hosta zamierzałem użyć). Ostatecznie uznałem, że nie potrzebuję wbudowanego edytora z funkcją life preview i do tej pory nie rozumiem dlaczego silnik blogowy &ndash; który można w uproszeniu sprowadzić do generatora statycznych stron WWW &ndash; wymaga obowiązkowej bazy danych.</li>
<li><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> &ndash; mój ostateczny wybór padł na chyba najprostszą dostępną opcję na rynku. Statyczny generator stron, z domyślną obsługą formatowania dokumentów w markdown, świetnym wbudowanym kolorowaniem pisowni skryptów, oraz możliwością update&#8217;ów bezpośrednio z Gita. Do tego hosting bezpośrednio przez <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, bez żadnych specjalnych ceremonii, tak jakby było to dowolne inne repozytorium. Żadnych baz danych, uwierzytelniania dla strony obsługiwanej przez 1 osobę, czy wbudowanych edytorów. Po prostu KISS ;)</li>
</ol>


<h2>Co dalej?</h2>

<p>Postanowiłem, że wraz z pozostałymi zmianami zmienię nieco samą ideę bloga. O ile przeniosłem większość starych wpisów, o tyle <strong>chciałem aby wszystkie kolejne posty były umieszczane po angielsku</strong>. Jest to decyzja ze względów praktycznych &ndash; większość programistów (w tym ja), kiedy napotyka jakiś problem, nie traci czasu na informacji w polskiej blogosferze, zamiast tego od razu sięgając do anglojęzycznych źródeł. Dodatkowo jest to dla mnie pewnego rodzaju wyzwanie oraz szansa na popracowanie nad językiem. Co do pozostałych problemów (statystyki, komentarze, itp.), wiele rzeczy wciąż czeka na dokończenie i może minąć nieco czasu, żeby postawić wszystko na nogi.</p>

<p>Podsumowując, witam na moim odświeżonym blogu w nowej formule.</p>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/10/20/o-pomykach-i-wnioskach-z-pracy-w-aspnet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>O wzorcach projektowych w ASP.NET MVC słyszał chyba każdy. Większość z nas przynajmniej raz widziała jakiś filmik instruktażowy bądź wideokonferencję promującą stosowanie właściwych wzorców na tej platformie. Jednakże po opanowaniu teorii przychodzi wreszcie pora na to, aby wcielić ją w życie. Co się wtedy okazuje? Bardzo często wychodzi na jaw, że zastosowanie poznanych praktyk w prawdziwym życiu sprawia problem, a kolejne miesiące programowania w myśl jakiejś metodyki prowadzą do ostatecznej refleksji będącej zgubą programistów: <em>zrobię cokolwiek byle zadziałało</em>.</p>

<p>W tym poście spróbuję opisać najczęstsze błędy, z którymi przyszło mi się zmierzyć &ndash; również te wynikające z ograniczeń technologii, ale przede wszystkim będące skutkiem niewłaściwego podejścia do problemu.</p>

<h2>Twoja encja ≠ Twój model</h2>

<p>Zasadniczym błędem (lub raczej skrótem myślowym) jest założenie, że każda klasa mapowana przez ORM na tabele może służyć jako model przekazywany bezpośrednio do widoku. Nie znaczy to, że jest to nie możliwe, jednak opcja ta jest z reguły nadużywana. Wynika to poniekąd ze stylu programowania wyuczonego z tutoriali z cyklu &ldquo;wyklep CRUDa w 5 min.&rdquo;. Piękne i proste, jednak nie mające wiele wspólnego z problemami dnia codziennego. Z drugiej strony jest to wina samego lenistwa programistów oraz przeświadczenia, że faza projektowania z rozpiską architektury chociażby na kartce papieru jest tylko dla kobiet i leszczy ;)</p>

<p>Pytanie brzmi: kiedy należałoby porzucić modelowanie z encji na rzecz dedykowanych klas POCO? Prawda jest taka, że zależy to od przypadku i wymaga odrobiny doświadczenia.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jedną z podpowiedzi może być poziom zagłębienia zależności. Im jest on głębszy, tym bardziej wykorzystywana przez nas klasa odbiega strukturą od modelu wymaganego przez widok. Przykładowo już 2 poziom zagłębienia np. <code>Model.Products.SelectMany(p => p.Orders)</code> może świadczyć o tym, że dana encja nie jest właściwym kandydatem i powinna zostać zmapowana na dedykowaną do tego celu klasę.</li>
<li>Innym przykładem może być sytuacja, w której nasz model wykazuje pewien związek z regułami biznesowymi. Przykładowo częstym sposobem reprezentacji okresu czasu powiązanego z danym obiektem jest dodanie do modelu dwóch pól określających granice czasowe. W tym momencie pojawia się jednak pewien dysonans między definicją biznesową (okres czasu jest pojedynczym obiektem) a rzeczywistą implementacją (okres czasu to dwa generyczne pola dat). Jeżeli logika biznesowa silnie bazuje na danej definicji np. przedział czasowy często pojawia się w kontekście wykonywanych operacji, wtedy możliwe, że lepiej byłoby wyodrębnić ją do osobnej klasy.</li>
<li>Jak powszechnie wiadomo, we współczesnym świecie aplikacji WWW wymagania klientów są jednymi z najbardziej zmiennych elementów systemu. Możliwość oddzielenia modeli od encji wspiera ten trend, ponieważ o ile encje są powiązane ze schematem bazy danych (przez co są znacznie mniej podatne na zmiany ze względu na konieczność utrzymania spójności z istniejącymi danymi), o tyle modele wykorzystywane przez nas w aplikacji mogą być swobodnie modelowane do naszych potrzeb.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Twój ViewData = Twój Model</h2>

<p>W przypadku niektórych frameworków model jest zdefiniowany w sposób jasny i jednoznaczny. W przypadku ASP.NET MVC nie jest jednak tak łatwo, ponieważ otrzymujemy tutaj więcej niż jeden sposób dostarczenia danych do widoku. Mowa tu oczywiście o ViewData. Wg. mnie obiekt ten, jakkolwiek przydatny, jest podstawowym złamaniem wzorca MVC w ASP.NET MVC. Dlaczego? Ponieważ &nbsp;prawda wygląda tak, że niezależnie od zdefiniowanych przez ciebie klas, prawdziwy model ma zawsze tylko jeden typ: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.viewdatadictionary(v=vs.108">ViewDataDictionary</a>.aspx).</p>

<p>Czy to źle? Niekoniecznie, zależy od przyjętego podejścia. Co z tego wynika? W przypadku modeli zwracanych przez formularze zazwyczaj przyjmuje się, że generyczny model powinien zawierać tylko te dane, które zostały wprowadzone przez użytkownika. Tzn. że informacje takie jak opcja wybrana przez użytkownika z listy powinna być częścią modelu podczas gdy sama lista dostępnych opcji powinna być przekazywana za pośrednictwem ViewBag/ViewData. Naturalnie w przypadku, gdy parsujemy model do postaci JSON przekazywanej do klienta, ta zasada nie dotyczy.</p>

<h2>Nic nie znaczące Error Messages</h2>

<p>Jednymi ze gorszych chwil w życiu programisty, są sytuacje, kiedy trzeba obsłużyć zgłoszenie o błędzie w aplikacji. Zdarza się, że zaglądamy wtedy do logów (o ile taką informację zalogowaliśmy ;) ), aby odnaleźć jakieś przydatne informacje, które pozwolą nam zidentyfikować naturę problemu. Jakże wielkie jest rozczarowanie, gdy jedynym hintem jaki wtedy otrzymujemy jest: <code>Object reference not set to an instance of an object.</code> Bardzo rzeczowa i jednoznaczna informacja wśród kilkuset linii kodu wymagających zbadania.</p>

<p>Innym ciężkim przypadkiem jest logowanie niewystarczającej ilości informacji. Przykład (blok try-catch jest czysto poglądowy):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">try</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">product</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">productRepository</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">GetById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">product</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Status</span> <span class="p">!=</span> <span class="n">ProductStatus</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Finished</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">InvalidStatusException</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Provided product has invalid status&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Exception</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="n">logger</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Message</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Co jest złego w tym przypadku? Wyobraźmy sobie, że dostajemy zgłoszenienie, o błędzie a w logach jedyną informacją jest: <code>Provided product has invalid status</code>. Czy wiemy o jakim statusie mowa? Czy wiemy o jaki produkt chodzi? Nie mamy żadnych informacji pozwalających zidentyfikować dany przypadek, mimo że wszystko co potrzebne mamy 2 linijki wyżej w kodzie źródłowym naszej aplikacji.</p>

<p>Stąd mój apel: nie bądź leniwcem, minuta pracy teraz pozwoli ci zaoszczędzić godziny problemów później.</p>

<h2>Too thin controllers, too fat services</h2>

<p><em>Fat models, thin controllers</em> jest zwrotem często używanym w świecie MVC. Często jednak wynikiem utrzymania tej reguły jest zjawisko, które sam określam jako papierowe kontrolery. Weźmy na przykład następującą akcję MVC:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="na">[HttpPost]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">ToggleUserBan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">activate</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">userService</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ToggleUserBan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">activate</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Na czym polega błąd? Prawdopodobnie metoda ToggleUserBan w serwisie jest przypadkiem zbyt szczegółowym. Daje to podstawy do przypuszczenia, że architektura aplikacji w którymś momencie się posypała. Zajrzyjmy więc do naszego hipotetycznego IUserService:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">interface</span> <span class="n">IUserService</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">ToggleUserBan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">flag</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// ...kolejne 70 metod</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Jeżeli widzisz taki interfejs, wiedz że coś się dzieje. To z czym mamy do czynienia to nic innego, jak zwykłe zamiatanie brudu pod dywan. Pseudorozwiązanie polegające na przeniesieniu proceduralnego makaronu w miejsce, w które rzadziej się zagląda. Jest to częsty rezultat braku rewizji kodu i testów jednostkowych, oraz samowoli programistów.</p>

<h2>Garść innych porad</h2>

<ul>
<li>unikaj static classes &ndash; utrudniają one modularyzację systemu i wprowadzają twarde powiązania, z których bardzo ciężko jest potem zrezygnować. Extension methods są w zasadzie jedynym zastosowaniem dla statycznych klas, dla jakich sam znajduję użytek.</li>
<li>unikaj partial classes &ndash; dopuszczalne tylko w wypadku, gdy rozszerzasz klasę generowaną przez zewnętrzne narzędzia (co swoją drogą samo w sobie jest złym pomysłem ale o tym może kiedy indziej ;) )</li>
<li>w przypadku zmiennych używaj nazw, które pozwalają określić ich typ i przeznaczenie &ndash; różnego rodzaju skróty oszczędzają dosłownie kilka sekund podczas pisania tylko po to, aby w przyszłości przedłużyć rozszyfrowywanie kodu przez kogoś innego o kilka minut. Pamiętaj, że w życiu programisty kod czyta się częściej niż pisze.</li>
<li>podczas zwracania kolekcji zwracaj najmniejszy interface, który umożliwia wykonanie zadania &ndash; nie ma sensu wymagać aby argument był listą, jeżeli jedynym wykonywanym na nim działaniem jest foreach</li>
<li>jeżeli zwracasz string lub kolekcje nigdy nie zwracaj nulli &ndash; zawsze używaj string.Empty lub Enumerable.Empty&lt;></li>
<li>nie sprawdzaj czy enumerator jest pusty przy pomocy Count() &ndash; używaj Any(). W przypadkach kiedy potrzebujesz porównać ilość argumentów w enumeratorze z konkretną liczbą np. list.Count() > 3, warto zastanowić się nad użyciem wzorca <a href="http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post4425_counting-iterators-lazily">LazyCounter</a></li>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/08/10/servicestack-alternatywa-dla-aspnet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ASP.NET jest wiodącą technologią, jeżeli idzie o rozwiązania webowe w środowisku .NET. I mimo, że pojęcie to samo w sobie nie jest jednolite (w ramach ASP występuje wiele oddzielnych technologii), to jednak niewiele słyszy się o alternatywach. A jest ich całkiem sporo:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a> &ndash; najbardziej znana alternatywa, o której opowiem więcej w dalszej części posta.</li>
<li><a href="http://nancyfx.org/">Nancy</a>&ndash; drugi obok ServiceStack, najbardziej znany framework, czerpiący inspirację ze znanego frameworka Sinatra, napisanego w Rubym.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openrasta/openrasta/wiki/Why-Choose-OpenRasta">OpenRasta</a>&ndash; biblioteka stworzona z myślą o tworzeniu API opartego o zasoby.</li>
<li><a href="http://amirrajan.net/Oak/">Oak</a> &ndash; framework mocno zainspirowany dynamiką bibliotek Ruby.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/2012/06/01/simple-web/">Simple.Web</a> &ndash; micro framework twórcy znanego micro ORMa Simple.Data, który umieszczam również w ramach ciekawostki.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sądzę, że dość niewiele osób słyszało te nazwy (zwłaszcza ostatnie dwie). Ja jednak postanowiłem opowiedzieć i zachęcić do najpopularniejszego z tych rozwiązań, czyli ServiceStack.</p>

<p>Co takiego otrzymujemy, decydując się na jego wykorzystanie?:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cały zestaw <em>extension methods</em> do wbudowanych typów .NET, przyspieszających pracę programistów.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Auto-mapping">Mechanizm mapowania obiektów</a> &ndash; podobny do AutoMappera, choć prostszy i bardziej ubogi.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Built-in-profiling">Profiler</a> wbudowany w środowisko.</li>
<li><a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=CreatingAValidator">Zaawansowany mechanizm walidacji</a>, umożliwiający m.in. warunkową walidację poszczególnych pól.</li>
<li>Mechanizm <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Authentication-and-authorization">autentykacji</a> i zarządzania dostępem oparty o role i uprawnienia z możliwością logowania poprzez OpenID.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/The-IoC-container">Kontener IoC</a> &ndash; również z możliwością podpięcia własnego.</li>
<li>Minimalistyczny framework ORM (<a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite">OrmLite</a>) &ndash; umożliwia on podłączenie do najpopularniejszych relacyjnych, baz danych. Naturalnie on również może być zastąpiony bardziej kompleksowym rozwiązaniem.</li>
<li>Wiązania do rózniej maści usług logowania (np. NLog, Elmah, Log4Net, EventLog, Enterprise Lib.) i cache&#8217;owania (np. domyślny InMemory, Memcached, Redis, Azure lub Amazon Web Services).</li>
<li>Bundlera plików JavaScript, CSS, LESS, SASS i CoffeeScript &ndash; chociaż trzeba przyznać, że jest to dość wyboista droga.</li>
<li>Mechanizm do kolejkowania wiadomości &ndash; obecnie tylko za pośrednictwem Redisa. Trwają prace nad wprowadzeniem bindingów do ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus oraz Amazon SQS.</li>
<li>Gotowe SDK do aplikacji klienckich pod C#, Silverlight, JavaScript oraz Dart.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ale mówiąc o jego najbardziej kompleksowych zaletach:</p>

<h2>Web services &amp; Content Negotiation</h2>

<p>Jest to &ndash; moim zdaniem &ndash; najciekawsza cecha Service Stack. Tworząc dotychczasowe usługi sieciowe z wykorzystaniem standardowych bibliotek .NET musieliśmy uzależniać technologię, jaką zamierzaliśmy wykorzystać od formatu danych, jakiego się spodziewaliśmy. A więc tworząc serwisy wykorzystujące SOAP lub XML tworzyliśmy dla nich specjalne usługi w WCFie. Jeżeli chcielibyśmy, aby zwracały one dane w postaci JSON, prawdopodobnie większość z nas wykorzystałaby najnowsze podejście w postaci ASP.NET Web API, dla pozostałych formatów ASP.NET.</p>

<p>Problemem takiego podejścia jest fakt, że za każdym z tych rozwiązań stoi osobna technologia, która nie jest kompatybilna z pozostałymi. Niezależnie od tego, co wybierzemy, nigdy nie otrzymamy kompletnego rozwiązania.</p>

<p>Jak wygląda to w przypadku ServiceStack? To proste. Każdy z modułów naszej aplikacji może być zamknięty w ramach klas dziedziczących po wspólnej klasie <code>Service</code>(jednak wbrew pozorom nie mamy tu do czynienia z wzorcem MVC) &ndash; lub w razie potrzeby, którejś z jej klas bazowych bądź interfejsu <code>IService</code>. Każda metoda obsługująca żądanie pobiera w parametrze obiekt POCO (Plain Old Class Object) i zwraca inny obiekt POCO. Dopiero na poziomie frameworka rozwiązywany jest problem serializacji danego obiektu do końcowego formatu, który może być wnioskowany na podstawie nagłówka HTTP, zawartości URL bądź dowolnego innego warunku, jaki zdefiniujemy podczas konfiguracji. Rozwiązanie to znane jest jako <em>Content Negotiation</em>. Dzięki temu jedna klasa może pełnić rolę kontrolera ASP.NET, WebAPI i serwisu WCF w tym samym czasie!</p>

<p>Domyślnie dysponujemy wbudowanymi serializatorami dla formatów: SOAP (1.1 oraz 1.2), XML, JSON, CSV i JSV. Dodatkowo w sieci można pobrać pluginy rozszerzające tą listę o niemal wszystkie formatery dostępne w świecie .NET, w tym też binarne. Jedna linijka kodu w konfiguracji nieraz wystarcza, aby wprowadzić dany format do naszej aplikacji. Warto zauważyć, że ta sama zasada panuje w przypadku dynamicznie generowanych stron HTML &ndash; po doinstalowaniu pluginu możemy generować strony w oparciu o składnię Razora oraz Markdown.</p>

<h2>Wydajność</h2>

<p>Twórcy ServiceStack zwracają szczególną uwagę na szybkość swojej platformy, w myśl powiedzenia: <i>&ldquo;We care about two things: speed and quality. And the quality we care about is speed&rdquo;</i>. Nie powinno więc dziwić, że większości wypadków framework ten przewyższa ASP.NET i WCF w kwestiach wydajnościowych. Wynika to z prostego faktu. Mamy tu do czynienia z inicjatywą open source, a w przedsięwzięciach tego typu dużą rolę odgrywa prostota. Nie ma tutaj miejsca na platformy typu Enterprise, z setkami warstw abstrakcji, pełnymi potworków typu <a href="http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/apidocs/org/apache/xmlrpc/server/RequestProcessorFactoryFactory.RequestSpecificProcessorFactoryFactory.html">RequestSpecificProcessorFactoryFactory</a>(tak, jest to wyraz mojego &ldquo;hejtu&rdquo; względem podejścia projektowego w Javie, ale fakt faktem problem ten dotyka również .NETu ;) ).</p>

<p>Konkretne porównania i benchmarki można znaleźć <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Real-world-performance">tutaj</a>. I jak widać, nie chodzi tu o jakiś pomijalny zysk rzędu kilkunastu procent.</p>

<h2>Testowalność</h2>

<p>ServiceStack jest frameworkiem z natury bardzo zmodularyzowanym, umożliwiającym wymianę poszczególnych komponentów. To z kolei czyni go naturalnym kandydatem do wprowadzenia testów jednostkowych.</p>

<p>Innym atutem jest podejście wymiany danych opartych na komunikatach (message-based design), które w wypadku ServiceStack są zwykłymi klasami POCO. Dzięki temu testując poszczególne moduły/usługi nie musimy przetwarzać wbudowanych we framework obiektów żądań i odpowiedzi. Zamiast tego mamy do czynienia ze standardowym zbiorem klas, zdefiniowanych przez nas samych, które z zewnątrz nie zdradzają zależności od używanego przez nas frameworka. Ponad to architektura sprawia, że najwygodniejszym podejściem jest budowa dużej ilości serwisów z małą ilością metod, co dodatkowo ułatwia zachowanie ziarnistości systemu.</p>

<h2>Wieloplatformowość</h2>

<p>Ostatnią wartą odnotowania cechą pozostaje fakt, że wybierając SS otrzymujemy w pełni funkcjonalny framework działający zarówno pod Windowsem jak i platformami linuxowymi. Wiem, że pod ASP również można programować w sposób pozwalający na postawienie aplikacji na Linuxie, ale jest to rozwiązanie niekompletne. Przykładowo, ServiceStack jest obecnie jedyną opcją pozwalającą na uruchomienie usług SOAP pod Mono.</p>

<p>Nie oznacza to jednak, że decydując się na SS, musimy rezygnować z naszej dotychczasowej aplikacji napisanej w ASP.NET. Równie dobrze możemy uruchomić hosta ServiceStack wewnątrz Global.asax i używać go np. tylko jako zamiennika warstwy nośnej dla usług WCF.</p>

<p>Całość doskonale wpisuje się w naturę technologii webowych, ich otwartość i multiplatformowość. Dodatkowo umożliwia ona optymalizację kosztów (hosting linuxowy jest średnio 5-krotnie tańszy niż porównywalny windowsowy) i otwiera nowe możliwości na rynku, który w przypadku .NET w ogromnej części składa się z aplikacji biznesowych.</p>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/06/26/garsc-pro-tipow-przydatnych-podczas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Od jakiegoś czasu myślałem o zebraniu w garść przemyśleń związanych z rozwojem projektów, bazując na doświadczeniach w aplikacjach, przede wszystkim biznesowych, w produkcji których przyszło mi uczestniczyć. Ponieważ pamięć jest zawodna i nie wszystko co chciałem wymienić udało mi się spamiętać i ubrać w słowa, być może w przyszłości będę kontynuował ten wątek.</p>

<p>Z góry zaznaczam, że tematy takie jak testy jednostkowe czy automatyzacja, celowo zostały tutaj przeze mnie potraktowane marginalnie. Jest tak dlatego, ponieważ są one wałkowane bez przerwy w wielu artykułach i każdy programista powinien się z nimi do tej pory zapoznać. Punkty jakie tutaj poruszam mogłby dotyczyć także tych dziedzin, postanowiłem jednak skupić się na odrobinę innych aspektach.</p>

<h2>1. &ldquo;Jesteśmy jedną rodziną, mamy wspólne korzenie&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Naturalną cechą aplikacji webowych rozwijanych w ramach środowiska .NET jest ich podział na wiele różnych projektów. Nie jest to wymóg, jednakże z reguły zdecydowanie pomaga w organizacji oraz w trakcie późniejszego wdrażania rozwiązań. To co jednak uznałem za warte przypomnienia to wzajemne powiązania pomiędzy projektami. Mówiąc zaś dokładniej, przydatność stworzenia wspólnej biblioteki-korzenia, dowiązywanej przez wszystkie pozostałe projekty w aplikacji.</p>

<p>Ma to kilka prostych przyczyn. Po pierwsze zdaża się, że musimy zaimplementować pewną funkcjonalność w kilku bibliotekach, będących na podobnym poziomie zależności, których jednak nie możemy powiązać ze sobą np. ze względu na rekurencyjne zapętlenie zależności &ndash; tutaj wspólny &ldquo;korzeń&rdquo; okazuje się nieoceniony. Po drugie, w trakcie pracy z aplikacją nieraz powstaje chęć stworzenia własnego DSLa bądź zestawu rozszerzeń upraszczających pracę z daną platformą bądź językiem. Ileż to razy rodziła się ochota na dodanie <em>extension method</em>, której brakuje nam w istniejących już klasach .NET? Tutaj również możliwość współdzielenia tego typu funkcjonalności jest bardzo przydatna.</p>

<p>Idea wspólnego &ldquo;korzenia&rdquo; przydaje się również kiedy mowa o klasach wyjątków. Dobrą praktyką w trakcie definiowania aplikacji jest wywoływanie własnych wyjątków, które mogą informować nie tylko o błędach w operacjach logicznych systemu, lecz również logice biznesowej jako takiej. Moim zdaniem wszystkie takie <em>customowe</em> wyjątki powinny mieć wspólną klasę bazową. Dzięki temu w późniejszych fragmentach aplikacji będziemy mogli bez problemu wychwytywać te z nich, które stworzyliśmy sami na potrzeby naszego systemu i odpowiednio na nie reagować &ndash; przekształać do postaci czytelnej dla końcowego użytkownika, logować itp.</p>

<h2>2. Atomic frontend design</h2>

<p>Atomic design to koncepcja projektowania elementów HTML w sposób uporządkowany na bazie kompozytów. Nieraz w życiu codziennym zdarza się nam określać komponenty strony w dość ogólny sposób, pozostawiając szczegóły implementacji na &ldquo;doprecyzowanie później&rdquo; ;) W rezultacie kończymy w morzu (lub raczej szambie) znaczników o mgliście oznaczonych brzegach. Ponieważ HTML na stronach może mieć bardzo rozrośniętą postać, którą jako programiści też będziemy musieli utrzymywać, warto zadbać też o ten aspekt aplikacji.</p>

<p>Idea atomic designu skupia się własnie na wiązaniu elementów HTML w kompozyty, które z kolei są łączone ze sobą dalej w kolejne, bardziej abstrakcyjne struktury. Więcej szczegółów na ten temat możecie dowiedzieć się <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">tutaj</a>. W praktyce warto poznać to podejście już teraz &ndash; w obecnej chwili widać wyłaniający się coraz mocniej trend, który w przyszłości może poskutować nowym standardem umożliwiającym definiowanie własnych znaczników HTML, mających bezpośrednie wsparcie ze strony silnika renderującego.</p>

<p>Chcąc wspomóc developerów i przygotować współczesne aplikacje webowe do nadchodzących standardów, inżynierowie Google&#8217;a stworzyli projekt <a href="http://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a> (czerpiący m.in. z koncepcji atomic designu), którego zadaniem jest zbudować odpowiednią platformę abstrakcji z istniejących już rozwiązań: HTML, Javascriptu oraz CSS. Zgodnie z ich przewidywaniami wraz z rozwojem przeglądarek funkcje oferowane przez tą bibliotekę mają w przyszłości zostać zastąpione specjalizowanymi, natywnymi odpowiednikami, zaś zadaniem polymeru jest umożliwić obecnym aplikacjom kompatybilność z dopiero powstającymi technologiami. Ciekawostka: mimo, że AngularJS stanowi oddzielny projekt, zapowiedziano już że w kolejnych wersjach będzie on coraz bardziej integrowany z polymerem.</p>

<h2>3. Stwórz własną platformę abstrakcji&hellip;</h2>

<p>Kolejna kwestia wynika z prostej tendencji uzależniania logiki aplikacji od wykorzystywanych bibliotek. W praktyce skutkuje to twardym związaniem naszego systemu z konkretnymi rozwiązaniami &ndash; które w przyszłości mogą stracić wsparcie, okazać się przestarzałe lub niewystarczające do naszych potrzeb. Taka monolityczna budowa nie jest przychylna zmianom, a jak powszechnie wiadomo klienci lubią wpadać na nowe pomysłu i zmieniać swoje zdanie.</p>

<p>Stąd też idealnym rozwiązaniem jest stworzenie klasycznej płaszczyzny abstrakcji, całkowicie izolującej naszą logikę biznesową, która stanowi jądro każdej aplikacji biznesowej, od zewnętrznych platform, realizowanych pośrednio jako obiekty proxy/adaptery. Piszę idealnym, w praktyce jednak rzadko takie rozwiązanie okazuje się w 100% możliwe. Warto jednak poświęcić mu trochę uwagi &ndash; również z perspektywy modularyzacji i możliwości testowania.</p>

<h2>4. &hellip; ale nie przeginaj z warstwami</h2>

<p>Pamiętaj, że każda dodatkowa wartwa abstrakcji z jednej strony umożliwia ci podzielenie problemu na prostsze, bardziej ogólne definicje (a ludzie z natury lubią pojmować świat ogólnikowo), z drugiej strony jednak stanowi jednocześnie kolejną barierę w optymalizacji.</p>

<p>To co warto przypomnieć, to fakt, że tworzenie aplikacji to proces, w którym wymagania zmieniają się w czasie. Produkcja oprogramowania nie jest jednym z konkursów algorytmicznych, gdzie wszelkie bariery i wartości graniczne są niezmienne i podane z góry. To co dziś świetnie się sprawdza, jutro może okazać się niewystarczające.</p>

<p>Ważnym czynnikiem jest odpowiednie zdefiniowanie problemu i dobór właściwych wzorców i rozwiązań. Jako programiści nieraz generalizujemy pewne problemy tak, aby dało się je rozwiązać przy pomocy istniejących technologii, kosztem rzeczywistej złożoności całego systemu. Dla zainteresowanych proponuję obejżeć <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/8-lines-code-refactoring">wykład</a> Grega Younga na ten temat.</p>

<p>Wielowarstwowe aplikacje stanowią pewien problem, kiedy przychodzi do optymalizacji. Nie oznacza to jednak, że budowa z podziałem na warstwy jest zła. Jest wygodna z punktu widzenia programisty i projektowania koncepcji rozwiązań dla problemów postawionych przed systemem. Z drugiej strony jednak każda aplikacja posiada pewne punkty zapalne &ndash; wymagające dużej wydajności &ndash; które będą wymagać niestandardowego trakowania, w tym też odejścia od wcześniej przyjętych koncepcji i zwrotu w stronę rozwiązań bardziej nisko poziomowych. Dobrze, aby aplikacja umożliwiała pewien sposób na osiągnięcie tego celu bez zaburzania reszty konstrukcji.</p>

<p>Jednym z możliwych kompromisów jest wielopoziomowy caching. Zamiast przebijać sie przez kolejne płaszczyzny abstrakcji w celu możliwości operowania na bardziej niskopoziomowych mechanizmach, cache&#8217;ujemy uzykiwane wartości na poszczególnych warstwach. Wielopoziomowy cache umożliwia też przyrostowe skalowanie wydajności w zależności od potrzeb.</p>

<h2>5. Kradnij&hellip;</h2>

<p>&hellip; moc obliczeniową maszyn klienta. Jest to bardzo dobre podejście, ponieważ wykonywanie części logiki po stronie przeglądarki nie dość, że odciąża serwery, za które musimy płacić, to dodatkowo stanowi rozwiązanie o wiele bardziej skalowalne, ponieważ ogólna ilość dostępnej mocy obliczeniowej rośnie wraz z liczbą maszyn wysyłających żądania na serwer. Stąd też część obliczeń, takich jak renderowanie dynamicznego HTMLa, czy preprocesowanie modelu danych od razu do postaci przystępnej do obliczeń po stronie serwera, można wykonywać bezpośrednio w przeglądarce.</p>

<h2>6. Oszukuj</h2>

<p>Co mam przez to na myśli? Po pierwsze powtarzam: cache&#8217;uj dane. W świecie aplikacji na platformie .NET często jest to opcja marginalizowana. W wielu przypadkach dopuszczalne jest, aby użytkownik zobaczył <em>przybliżone</em> dane. A co jeżeli nie są one aktualne? <em>Keep calm and oj tam oj tam</em> ;)</p>

<p>Problem, z którym się też spotkałem, to stosowanie <em>prymitywych</em> cache&#8217;ów w miejscach, w których ciężko określić górną granicę przyrostu danych. Tak, zwykły .NETowy słownik może wystarczy w twoim środowisku developerskim, ale w momencie, gdy za rok dane pompowane do niego na produkcji będą liczone w setkach tysięcy (lub więcej) obiektów, wszyscy na własne oczy zobaczą, że wyprodukowałeś trabanta w cenie porsche. Technologie sprawdzone na polu walki, takie jak Memcache i Redis są tutaj, gotowe cię wesprzeć. Korzystaj z tej możliwości.</p>

<p>Po drugie pamiętaj o złotej zasadzie &ndash; czego user nie dotknie, tego sercu nie żal. Przykład-anegdota: swego czasu aplikacje na urządzenia Apple były podawane jako wzór szybko uruchamiających się programów. Aplikacja, która na innych systemach uruchamiała się w kilka sekund, na iPhone była gotowa w ułamku tego czasu. Na czym polegał sekret? Otóż w rzeczywistości to, co widział użytkownik, było w rzeczywistości zrzutem ekranu z działającej aplikacji, bez jakichkolwiek możliwości interakcji. Dzięki temu użytkownik miał wrażenie, że aplikacja uruchamia się niemal natychmiast. W rzeczywistości, zanim wykonał on jakąkolwiek akcję w UI, mijało parę sekund, w trakcie których program miał czas, aby się załadować i podstawić pod &ldquo;zaślepkę&rdquo; faktyczny interfejs użytkownika.</p>

<p>Liczę na to, że lektura ta okazała się ciekawa i być może uda mi się w przyszłości opisać dalsze koncepty i przemyślenia.</p>

    <link href="http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/06/16/czego-programisci-net-mogliby-nauczyc/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-16T12:28:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/06/16/czego-programisci-net-mogliby-nauczyc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>.NET był wybraną przeze mnie technologią niemal od początku mojej przygody z programowaniem. Uważam jednak, że programista nie powinien się zamykać w jednej szyfladce i poznawać szerokie spectrum technologii. Porównywać je i znać wady oraz zalety każdej z nich. Ostatecznie zaś umieć dobrać właściwą technologię do rozwiązania napotykanych problemów &ndash; nie odwrotnie ;)</p>

<p>Stąd też pytanie w temacie. Czy faktycznie programiści .NET mogą nauczyć się czegoś ze środowiska Ruby, języka, który ostatnimi czasy zbiera niemało batów (głównie związanych z wydajnością oraz bezpieczeństwem jego najpopularniejszej platformy, RoRa)? Otóż jak się okazuje całkiem sporo, nawet pomimo już istniejącego trendu absorbowania do platformy .NET sporej ilości rozwiązań napotykanych w konkurencyjnych gałęziach. Poniżej postaram się wymienić te, które moim zdaniem są warte odnotowania.</p>

<h2>1. Przestań polegać na swoim IDE</h2>

<p>Nie da się tego ukryć &ndash; Visual Studio jest jednym z najlepszych, o ile nie najlepszym IDE, z jakim programista może mieć obecnie przyjemność pracować. Ma to jednak pewną cenę. W pewnym momencie zaczynamy polegać na swoim IDE w stopniu większym, niż na własnych umiejętnościach. Co gorsza przenosi się to bezpośrednio na tworzone biblioteki (przykład&hellip; Entity Framework &ndash; czy ktoś próbował kiedyś stworzyć model edmx bez pomocy wizarda wbudowanego w Visual Studio?). Jeżeli nie możesz sprawnie korzystać z biblioteki bez wsparcia swojego IDE, oznacza to, że jest ona zbyt skomplikowana i najzwyczajniej w świecie zepsuta.</p>

<p>W przypadku Ruby&#8217;ego, narzędzie pracy jest kwestią gustu. Jednakże kiedy pierwszy raz przyszło mi pracować z teamem RoR każde z nich w porównaniu do Visual Studio wygląda jak notatnik z kolorowaniem składni. Żadnego zaawansowanego refactoringu, intellisense, nawigacji między plikami w projekcie, generowania buildów. Co było w tym najzabawniejsze? Po 2 tygodniach wcale mi tego nie brakowało. Przysłowiowy notatnik + konsola całkowicie wystarczały do pracy, zaś narzędzia są skonstruowane tak, aby programista był sobie w stanie poradzić ze wszystkim zaraz po zainstalowaniu interpretera.</p>

<h2>2. Debuger jest opcją, nie obowiązkiem</h2>

<p>W świecie .NET jest to dziwna opinia. Wielu programistów wykorzystuje go jako normalne narzędzie pracy służące sprawdzeniu, czy aplikacja działa poprawnie. Dodatkowo sam Visual Studio ułatwia takie podejście. Jako programista Ruby nigdy nie musiałem skorzystać z debuggera &ndash; prawdę mówiąc, nigdy go nie zainstalowałem. Nie oznacza to oczywiście, że kod napisany w Rubym jest zawsze właściwy. Wynika to z innego podejścia. W tym środowisku standardem jest pisanie unit testów do weryfikacji każdej bardziej złożonej części systemu. Dzięki temu testy w Rubym są domyślnym <strong>must have</strong> przy każdym projekcie.</p>

<h2>3. Nie bój się eksperymentować</h2>

<p>To co najbardziej spodobało mi się we współpracy z programistami Ruby, to otwartość na nowinki, chęć wypróbowania innych podejść. Wiąże się z tym pewne ryzyko, ale również określony zysk. Tutaj powstaje pewien problem &ndash; ryzyko w skostniałym świecie aplikacji biznesowych z reguły jest czymś nie do przyjęcia. Dodatkowym hamulcem jest tutaj fakt, że wielu starszych programistów ze środowiska .NET nieprzychylnie patrzy na rozwiązania open source (w końcu kogo wtedy pociągnąć do odpowiedzialności?) oraz ogólnie technologiom spoza kółka Microsoftu.</p>

<p>Nie należy bać się zmian. Nawet jeżeli ryzyko jest nieakceptowalne w aplikacjach dla klientów zewnętrznych, wciąż możemy wprowadzać drobne zmiany dla systemów używanych wewnątrz firmy oraz wypróbowywać tam nowe podejścia. Z jednej strony może to przełożyć się na zysk w przyszłości, z drugiej działa to jak magnes na programistów-pasjonatów, a takich nigdy nie ma za wielu, prawda? ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artykuł ten tworzę z dość prostego powodu. Wraz z mijającym czasem w każdym programiście rośnie opór oraz lenistwo wobec powtarzalnych czynności wykonywanych codziennie w pracy. Stąd też szukamy sposobów na zautomatyzowanie choć części z tych zadań. PowerShell może być jednym ze sposobów na osiągnięcie tego celu. Z tego powodu warto lepiej się z nim zapoznać.</p>

<p>Zanim zacznę, chcę zaznaczyć, że nie jestem mistrzem PS. Postanowiłem jednak podzielić się swoimi doświadczeniami z punktu widzenia typowego programisty .NET i w miarę zwięźle pokazać, w jaki sposób przenieść niektóre z najpopularniejszych operacji występujących w tym świecie na ich odpowiedniki w PowerShellu. Zaczynajmy.</p>

<p>Rzecz, którą nieraz warto zrobić przed rozpoczęciem właściwej pracy, to uruchomienie PowerShella w trybie administratora. Możemy to zrobić bezpośrednio z poziomu <strong>cmd.exe</strong> za pomocą komendy:<code>powershell &ldquo;Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs&rdquo;</code>.</p>

<h3>Kilka przydatnych cmdletów</h3>

<p>Na koniec chciałbym pokazać kilka cmdletów, które nieraz ułatwiają pracę. Warto zauważyć, że nieraz cmdlet dostępny jest również poprzez alias (przeważnie więcej niż jeden). Niektóre z nich zostały tutaj przedstawione.</p>

<p>PS: W niektórych z powyższych komend wykorzystałem jeden z feature&#8217;ów PowerShella, którego wcześniej nie opisałem &ndash; <strong>pipeline operator</strong>. Jest on reprezentowany przez symbol <code>|</code> i służy do przekazywania wyniku jednej funkcji/polecenia jako wejścia do następnej.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-14T20:02:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/05/14/zapowiedz-ruby-21-generational-heap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nie minęło wiele czasu od wydania Ruby&#8217;ego w wersji 2.0, a już pojawiła się ciekawa nowinka &ndash; od wersji 2.1 MRI ma wspierać generacje na zarządzanej stercie. Była to dla mnie wiadomość o tyle ciekawsza, że do tej pory sądziłem, że nie jest to możliwe bez zerwania kompatybilności z niskopoziomowymi rozszerzeniami języka C, które znajdują się w niektórych bibliotekach &ndash; tymczasem zapewniono, że żadna tego typu sytuacja nie będzie mieć miejsca.</p>

<h2>Generacje w Rubym (MRI)</h2>

<p>Jak więc ma wyglądać nowy mechanizm GC? Do tej pory wiadomo niewiele, dlatego postaram się podzielić szczegółami, które udało mi się zebrać. Nowy garbage collector nosi nazwę <strong>RGenGC</strong> i domyślnie będzie dzielił stertę na dwie generacje &ndash; często odśmiecana przestrzeń niewielkiego rozmiaru dla obiektów krótkotrwałych (obiekty tworzone w zakresach lokalnych metod często kończą tu swój żywot) oraz przestrzeń obiektów długotrwałych, awansowanych z pierwszej generacji.</p>

<p>Dotychczasowym problemem była konieczność zmiany adresów obiektów, związana z przenoszeniem obiektu pomiędzy generacjami. O ile MRI mogłoby śledzić takie &ldquo;ruchome&rdquo; instancje, o tyle rozszerzenia napisane w języku C nie są w stanie tego zrobić (wewnętrznie referencje na obiekty w Rubym są po prostu zwykłymi wskaźnikami). Jak rozwiązano ten problem? Postanowiono podzielić referencje na obiekty na dwie klasy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lśniące (<em>shiny</em>) &ndash; obiekty z takimi referencjami mogą być swobodnie śledzone i przenoszone pomiędzy generacjami zarządzanej sterty.</li>
<li>Ciemne (<em>shady</em>) &ndash; w momencie, kiedy jakiś obiekt zostanie wykorzystany z poziomu C, zostaje on przypisany do tej klasy. Obiekty tego typu nie mogą być przenoszone ani zebrane przez kolektor, dopóki są wykorzystywane przez kod niezarządzany.</li>
</ul>


<p>Przypomina to znane z innych środowisk mechanizmy współpracy pomiędzy kodem wysoko- i niskopoziomowym (w .NET takie &ldquo;nieprzenaszalne&rdquo; obiekty noszą nazwę <em>pinned objects</em>).</p>

<p>Jaki ma to wpływ na wydajność? Dotychczas nie stworzono oficjalnych benchmarków, nieoficjalnie mówi się o kilku procentowej poprawie względem poprzedniego rozwiązania. Należy jednak pamiętać, że prace wciąż trwają i wiele może się jeszcze zmienić.</p>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/04/23/o-redundancji-w-wyrazeniach-linq</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>O tym, czym jest redundacja wie chyba każdy programista. Każdy z nas wie również, że jest to zjawisko nieporządane i w większości wypadków lepiej mu zapobiegać. Ten post przeznaczę na opis przykładowego zjawiska powtórzeń w zapytaniach LINQ spotykanego w sytuacjach codziennych oraz prostym i czytelnym ich rozwiązaniu, o którym nieraz zapominamy.</p>

<h2>Przykład</h2>

<p>Weźmy pod uwagę następujący przykład &ndash; otrzymaliśmy dokumentację, w której opisana jest pewna encja. Może ona mieć następującą postać:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Document</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">DateTime</span> <span class="n">CreateDate</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">string</span> <span class="n">Type</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">get</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">set</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">// .. reszta implementacji</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>W ramach logiki biznesowej wykonywanej na encjach tej klasy stworzone zostało pojęcie przeterminowania &ndash; z dalszej części dokumentacji dowiadujemy się, że za przeterminowane uznajemy te encje, w których data utworzenia jest starsza niż X dni (X może być dowolne np. ustawione w konfiguracji systemu) zaś typ przybiera konkretną wartość. Bez trudu zawężamy więc wyniki za pomocą zapytania:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">documents</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">DataContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Documents</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CreateDate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddDays</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span> <span class="n">DateTime</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Now</span> <span class="p">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Type</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="s">&quot;M1&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Niestety w późniejszym czasie słowo &ldquo;przeterminowany&rdquo; pojawia się w tym kontekscie jeszcze kilka razy w różnych miejsach aplikacji. Co robimy? W większości spotkanych przeze mnie przypadków piszemy klauzulę <code>Where(&hellip;)</code> ponownie. Ale czy na pewno?</p>

<h2>Inne podejście</h2>

<p>Rozwiązaniem powyżej sytuacji może być stary dobry <em>monkey patching</em>, reprezentowany w C# przez mechanizm extension methods. Z jego użyciem moglibyśmy rozwiązać ten problem w następujący sposób:</p>

<p>Przykład wykorzystania:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">expiredDocuments</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">DataContext</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Documents</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Expired</span><span class="p">();</span>

<p>W ten sposób stworzyliśmy stereotyp, który możemy wykorzystywać zawsze w sytuacji kiedy mamy do czynienia z tym konkretnym zachowaniem. Jakie są zalety tego podejścia? Po pierwsze trzymamy się zasady DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself). Po drugie sądzę, że taki zapis jest o wiele bardziej czytelny i ułatwia późniejsze zrozumienie kontekstu, w jakim wykonywane są zapytania.</p>

<p>Innym sposobem na rozwiązanie powyższego problemu jest naturalnie przeniesienie filtru bezpośrednio do kontekstu danych:<code>var data = DataContext.GetExpiredDocuments();</code>. Na czym jednak polega przewaga monkey patchingu? Po pierwsze nie jesteśmy twardo związani ze źródłem danych &ndash; napisany wcześniej stereotyp może być zastosowany dla dowolnej kolekcji, nawet takiej która powstała w wyniku deserializacji żądania HTTP. Po drugie rozwinięcie to można wstawić w dowolnym momencie tworzonego zapytania, z dowolnej encji posiadające odpowiednią relację.</p>

<p>W rezultacie otrzymujemy rozwiązanie bardziej uniwersalne i podatne na zmiany.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>W tym poście postanowiłem zebrać kilka technologii usprawniających zabawę stylami i HTMLem, wykorzystując Visual Studio 2012 jako narzędzie codziennej pracy. Część z nich cieszy się już sporą popularnością w świecie web developerów innych środowisk, zaś w świecie .NET stawiają swoje pierwsze kroki.</p>

<p>Zanim zacznę właściwą część postu, chcę wszystkim przypomnieć o <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ed4c78f-a23e-49ad-b5fd-369af0c2107f">Web Essentials</a>. Jest to absolutny <em>must have</em> jeżeli chodzi o web development w VS2012. Wiele z feature&#8217;ów opisywanych przeze mnie dalej jest już wbudowanych w to rozszerzenie.</p>

<h2>Zen Coding</h2>

<p>Jeżeli chodzi o kwestie tworzenia szablonów dynamicznych stron HTML, możemy podzielić programistów na dwie grupy. Pierwsza z nich to szczęściarze, mogący budować szablonych za pomocą czytelnych, przejżystych notacji (np. <a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a> lub <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>). Druga (czyli reszta ;) ) to osoby zmuszane do osadzania dynamicznego kodu w otoczce pseudo-HTML. Z myślą o tej drugiej grupie powstał standard znany powszechnie jako Zen Coding. O co w nim chodzi? Załóżmy, że chcielibyśmy stworzyć kod HTML w następującej postaci:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Menu<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;menu&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nie jestem chyba jedyną osobą, która uważa, że pisanie czegoś takiego z palca to strata czasu? Z pomocą ZenCoding możemy to uprościć do następującej postaci:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>#container&gt;p{Menu}+ul.menu&gt;(li&gt;a)*5
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>W przypadku Web Essentials dla VS2012 jedyne co musimy zrobić, to umieścić takie wyrażenie w nowej linii oraz nacisnąć Tab (natychmiast po końcu wyrażenia bez spacji), aby wygenerować wynikowy HTML.</p>

<h2>Prekompilowany CSS</h2>

<p>Do niedawna była to jeszcze nowinka. Jednakże zalety notacji takich jak <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> czy <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> szybko zapewniły im właściwe miejsce. Zastanówmy się, dlaczego warto z nich korzystać?</p>

<ul>
<li>Przyswajalność &ndash; że nauka nowej notacji zajmuje kilka godzin/dni.</li>
<li>Usunięcie powtarzalności kodu &ndash; stosując zmienne, wartości wyliczane oraz zagłębione style, mozemy osiągnąć nasz cel szybciej oraz bez konieczności kopiowania tych samych linijek. W dodatku powstały w ten sposób kod jest bardziej podatny na zmiany niż jego statyczny odpowiednik.</li>
<li>Hierarchizacja &ndash; stosowanie importów jest kolejnym krokiem usuwajacym powtarzalny kod, jak również umożliwia podział kodu CSS na konkretne jednostki odpowiedzialności. Pozwala również w pewnym stopniu usunąć konieczność łączenia plików CSS za pomocą bundlerów.</li>
<li>Rozmiar &ndash; narzędzia takie jak Web Essentials automatycznie kompilują pliki .less do kodu CSS podczas zapisu zmian w pliku. Dodatkowo są w stanie skompilować je osobno do postaci z wcięciami (czytelnej dla developera) oraz zminimalizowanej (pozbawionej białych znaków) &ndash; doskonałej do zastosowania w środowisku produkcyjnym.</li>
</ul>


<p>W skrócie pozwala nam wprowadzić odrobinę porządku i organizacji w dziedzinę, która do tej pory jest powszechnie uważana za żmudną, powtarzalną i chaotyczną.</p>

<h2>Palety barw</h2>

<p>Nie ma co ukrywać. Programista nie jest artystą-grafikiem i nie powinno się oczekiwać od niego estetyki i twórczości na poziomie zawodowego designera. Czasem jednak okazuje się, że gotowy layout wykorzystywany na naszej stronie jest niewystarczający i musimy skombinować na szybko &ldquo;coś własnego&rdquo;, czy to w formie dodatkowego stylu czy motywu do odznaczenia części strony.</p>

<p>W takim wypadku z pomocą przychodzi <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/">Adobe Kuler</a>. Umożliwia on dostosowanie istniejącego lub zdefiniowanie własnego motywu kolorystycznego do wykorzystania na stronie zgodnie z powszechnymi regułami rządzącymi zasadami kompozycji barw.</p>

<h2>CSS &ndash; czy wiesz z czego korzystasz?</h2>

<p>Czy tworząc plik CSS zastanawialiście się, jak duża część opisanych przez was reguł faktycznie jest wykorzystywana na stronie? Chrome umożliwia sprawdzenie tego w dość prosty sposób. Wystarczy z poziomu Developer Tools uruchomić Audyt na zakładce o tej samej nazwie. Po kilku sekundach jesteśmy w stanie zauważyć coś w ten deseń:</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eBhklZN4A_g/UXL2pqSMowI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/ztKUIviVimU/s1600/chrome-devtool.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eBhklZN4A_g/UXL2pqSMowI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/ztKUIviVimU/s320/chrome-devtool.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>


<p>Jaki wynik osiągacie na swojej stronie? ;) Powiem szczerze, że wykorzystywanie około 40% dołączonych reguł można uznać za wysoki wynik.</p>

    <id>http://bartoszsypytkowski.com/blog/2013/03/20/niska-wydajnosc-rubyego-studium</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We współczesnym świecie aplikacji webowych Ruby oraz jego główna (często utożsamiana z nim) platforma, Ruby on Rails, są przykładem świetnego dopasowania języka do zbioru metodyk i stosu technologicznego nastawionego na maksymalizację wydajności pracy programisty. Stanowią one &ldquo;wylęgarnię&rdquo; nowatorskich praktyk, które nieraz przenikają dalej i zostają zaadaptowane przez inne środowiska. Wystarczy podać kilka przykładów ze środowiska .NET: migracje w najnowszym EF4.3+, kierunek w jakim zmierza cały ASP.NET MVC czy dynamizacja języka C# &ndash; myśleliście, że idea stojąca za LINQ to nowatorski pomysł? ;) .</p>

<p>Niestety za każym razem, kiedy mowa o Rubym, powracają kwestie jego wydajności. Jest to pięta achillesowa tego języka, powtarzana jak mantra w kolejnych dyskusjach programistów. Na czym jednak polegają te problemy? W tym postcie postaram się je opisać (w odniesieniu do najpopularniejszego kompilatora Ruby&#8217;ego &ndash; MRI) oraz opowiedzieć o rozwiązaniach, jakie zostały zaadaptowane w innych językach. Ponieważ moje obserwacje będę porównywał do innych implementacji, w tym Javy, C#, Pythona i różnych wirtualnych maszyn JavaScriptu, liczę że każdy będzie mógł wynieść z tego jakąś przydatną wiedzę.</p>

<h2>Garbage Collector</h2>

<p>Ten wątek musiał się tu pojawić, dlatego też postanowiłem zacząć właśnie od niego. Rozdział ten będzie dość trudny do przełknięcia dla osób, które z teorią stojącą za językami programowania nigdy nie miały do czynienia. Zanim przejdą one dalej, proponuję zaznajomić się z <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science">tym wpisem</a>) na Wikipedii.</p>

<p>W dużym skrócie, Garbage collector w MRI wykorzystuje (podobnie jak wszystkie najpopularniejsze współcześnie maszyny wirtualne) algorytm <em>mark and sweep</em>. Jest to jednak pojęcie bardzo szerokie. Zagłębiając się w detale, dochodzimy do pewnych różnic.</p>

<h3>Podział zarządzanego stosu</h3>

<p>Większość programistów Javy i .NET zapewne kojarzy, że zarządzana sterta występująca w tych językach nie jest strukturą jednolitą, lecz jest podzielona na wiele przestrzeni (mowa tu o generacjach, ale nie tylko). I tak w przypadku .NET &ndash; na przykładzie SGena używanego w Mono, a świetnie opisanego <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Generational_GC">tutaj</a> mamy do czynienia z podziałem sterty na kilka zbiorów:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generacje</strong> &ndash; Zazwyczaj istnieją dwie lub więcej. Pierwszą jest <strong>żłobek</strong> (<em>nursery</em>). Ten zbiór jest relatywnie mały (domyślnie 4MB dla SGena, &frac12; pamięci cache L2 dla Pythona made by PyPy) i często czyszczony. Jest sprawny głównie ze względu na fakt, że większość obiektów przechowywanych na stercie ma stosunkowo krótki czas istnienia (np. zmienne lokalne funkcji/metod, które są niepotrzebne poza zakresem danej metody). Obiekty bardziej długowieczne przenoszone są na sterty kolejnych generacji. W rezultacie pamięć jest czyszczona częściej, jednak liczy się tutaj rozmiar przeszukiwanej pamięci (żłobek jest mały, przez co jego znakowanie i czyszczenie trwa bardzo krótko).</li>
<li><strong>Przestrzeń dużych obiektów</strong> &ndash; ponieważ naprawdę duże obiekty są dość ciężkie do alokacji (znalezienie na stercie jednolitego bloku pamięci nie zajętego przez inne obiekty może być wyzwaniem), są one rozpatrywane osobno, zarówno na wirtualnych maszynach Javy jak i .NETu (tak w przypadku Mono jak i M$).</li>
<li><strong>Łańcuchy znaków (string)</strong> &ndash; tekst jest również traktowany w specjalny sposób. Przykładowo wpisując w dwóch różnych miejscach w kodzie <em>&ldquo;ala ma kota&rdquo;</em> w praktyce definiujemy ten łańcuch znaków tylko raz, tworząc do niego dwie referencje. Ta zasada dotyczy zarówno Javy, .NETu, Pythona oraz najnowszych silników JavaScriptu. Ruby nie implementuje tej funkcjonalności &ndash; moim zdaniem na przeszkodzie stoi tutaj natura stringów w tym języku, które zgodnie ze specyfikacją mogą być mutowalne.</li>
</ul>


<p>Niestety w Rubym brakuje podziału sterty na generacje, przez co jest ona błyskawicznie zapychana obiektami o krótkim czasie życia, zaś &ldquo;sprzątnięcie&rdquo; całej sterty zajmuje sporo czasu. W chwili obecnej nie jest to możliwe, ponieważ GC w MRI nie implementuje przenoszenia obiektów wewnątrz sterty (dlaczego tak jest opowiem dalej).</p>

<h3>Co znajduje się na stosie</h3>

<p>W przypadku <strong>Javy</strong> sprawa podziału alokacji pomiędzy stos i stertę wygląda stosunkowo prosto: typy natywne i referencje na obiekty lądują na stosie, a reszta (obiekty klas) na stertę. W przypadku <strong>C#</strong> jest to trochę bardziej skomplikowane, ponieważ na stosie mogą wylądować również obiekty-struktury (<em>struct</em>) oraz obiekty utworzone za pomocą słowa kluczowego <strong>stackallock</strong>.</p>

<p>Pomiędzy GC Javy (oraz javascriptowym V8) a Mono istnieje dodatkowa różnica: dwa pierwsze stosują tzw. precyzyjne wskaźniki, tzn. podczas przechodzenia po stosie przez marker (uruchamiany przez GC w pierwszej fazie pracy i służący oznaczeniu obiektów, które trzeba sprzątnąć) natrafiając na wartości od razu wie, czy są one wartościami czy referencjami na obiekty znajdujące się na stercie. Przykładowo maszyna wirtualna JavaScriptu z Chroma używa do tego specjalnego bitu określającego czy dana wartość jest referencją (stąd na V8 w wersji 32-bitowej liczby całkowite są wewnętrznie składowane jako wartości <em>31-bitowe</em>). Niestety SGen Mono musi za każdym razem sprawdzić (a w razie wątpliwości założyć z góry), czy taka wartość wskazuje adres na stercie.</p>

<p>W przypadku Ruby&#8217;ego sprawa wygląda częściowo prościej: w tym języku nie istnieją typy wartościowe, zatem wszystkie wartości (w tym liczby oraz flagi logiczne) są reprezentowane przez obiekty składowane na zarządzanej stercie. To sprawia, że czas dostępu do nich jest dłuższy.</p>

<p>Inna niespodzianka, jaką szykuje nam Ruby, sięga jeszcze dalej. Interpreter MRI (do nadejścia wersji 1.9) konstruował kod Ruby&#8217;ego przez pośrednią translację do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">drzewa AST</a>. Jednakże chcąc zapewnić programistom &ldquo;pełnię władzy&rdquo; nad kodem, tak stworzone drzewo było składowane w postaci struktur Ruby&#8217;ego na jego zarządzanej stercie! Oznacza to, że cały aktualnie wykonywany kod jest reprezentowany przez faktycznie istniejące drzewo obiektów, zajmujące ogromną ilość pamięci.</p>

<h3>Jak zarządzana jest sterta: .NET Mono</h3>

<p>Kolejne zestawienie z Mono. Mówiąc dość ogólnie sterta jest podzielona na tak zwane bloki, one z kolei na sloty. Podczas oznaczania obiektów na stercie dzielimy je na 3 typy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Root objects</strong> &ndash; są to obiekty, do których znaleziono referencje na stosie i które nie powinny zostać usunięte.</li>
<li><strong>Garbage </strong>&ndash; a zatem obiekty-śmieci oraz puste przestrzenie, które mogą zostać realokowane pod nowe obiekty.</li>
<li><strong>Pinned objects</strong> &ndash; specjalny rodzaj tzw. przypiętych obiektów. Są to obszary pamięci wyjęte spoza kontroli zarządzanej sterty, a więc np. struktury z języka C, na które mamy referencje z poziomu P/Invoke oraz obiekty przypięte ręcznie w zakresach <strong>unsafe</strong> (za pomocą słowa kluczowego <strong>fixed</strong>). W Mono do tej listy dochodzą również te adresy, które zostały znalezione na stosie, ale nie koniecznie wskazują na obiekty. Ze względów bezpieczeństwa takich obiektów nie można odśmiecać.</li>
</ul>


<p>Z punktu widzenia Garbage Collectora najbardziej upierdliwe są pinned objects. Dlaczego? Otóż w trakcie odśmiecania pamięci GC zostawia &ldquo;dziury&rdquo; pustych przestrzeni, które mogą posłużyć w przyszłości do zaalokowania nowych obiektów. Niestety te dziury powodują fragmentację pamięci. Co z tego, że mamy 10 luk po 100 bajtów, jeżeli potrzebujemy stworzyć obiekt rozmiaru 200B? Dlatego też GC w Mono został wyposażony w opcję realokacji obiektów &ndash; umożliwia to przesunięcie położenia obiektów w pamięci tak, aby złączyć luki powstałe po odśmiecaniu w 1 ciągły blok w pamięci.</p>

<h3>Jak zarządzana jest sterta: Ruby</h3>

<p>Z punktu widzenia MRI sterta również jest podzielona na komórki, które są reprezentowane w pamięci jako zwykłe struktury C (dokładna nazwa to <em>struct VALUE</em>).</p>

<p>Ciekawostką jest sposób znajdowania pustych fragmentów na stercie służących pod przyszłe alokacje obiektów. Do wersji 2.0 (a więc we wszystkich obecnie używanych) mamy do czynienia ze strukturą przyjmującą postać linked listy. Szukając nieużywanych komórek musieliśmy przeglądać kolejne węzły z listy i sprawdzać ich zajętość &ndash; przeskakiwanie po pamięci oraz znalezienie odpowiednio dużego ciągłego bloku może być czasochłonne, sama lista również ma swój rozmiar. Od wersji 2.0 zamieniono ją inną strukturą &ndash; bitmapą. Od teraz za każdym razem, kiedy tworzona jest zarządzana sterta, część pamięci na jej początku zostaje zarezerwowana na potrzeby bitmapy. Określa ona w prosty sposób (ustawiając lub zerując kolejne bity w pamięci) zajętość kolejnych komórek VALUE. Przeszukiwanie takiej struktury jest o wiele szybsze, zajmuje ona też mniej miejsca w pamięci &ndash; ponieważ bloki RValue mają po 40 bajtów i wymagają 1 bitu do sygnalizacji łatwo wyliczyć, że ostateczna bitmapa zajmuje około 1/(40*8) = 1/320 rozmiaru całej sterty.</p>

<p>Do czego sprowadza się największy (moim zdaniem) problem Ruby&#8217;ego? Otóż GC w MRI nie dysponuje opcją przenoszenia obiektów. Porównując do Mono wszystkie obiekty w Rubym traktowane są jako pinned object. Niesie to szereg następstw m.in. w przypadku konieczności alokacji dużego obiektu na stercie o mocno sfragmentowanej strukturze, może istnieć potrzeba rozszerzenia rozmiaru sterty (a zatem zwiększenia zużycia RAMu w całym programie) pomimo, że istnieje dostateczna ilość miejsca, aby taki obiekt zaalokować.</p>

<p>Czy można zmienić GC w Rubym na taki, który zdolny jest przesuwać obiekty? Nie. Na drodze stoją tu referencje na obiekty, które wewnątrz są w rzeczywistości zwykłymi wskaźnikami na bloki pamięci bezpośrednio na stercie. Przesunięcie obiektu na stercie wiąże się ze zmianą jego adresu, ponieważ jednak nie wiemy ile referencji (których w algorytmie <em>mark&amp;sweep</em> nie zliczamy) należy powiadomić o nowej lokacji obiektu, taka operacja nie jest możliwa. Naturalnie można to zmienić (np. wprowadzić wskaźniki pośrednie), jednakże spowoduje to dysonans między dotychczasowymi implementacjami wtyczek z języka C montowanych do Ruby&#8217;ego i zniszczy jego kompatybilność wstecz. Niestety sądzę, że prędzej czy później ta decyzja musi zostać podjęta.</p>

<h2>Klątwa języków dynamicznych</span></h2>

<p>Kolejnym krokiem w zrozumieniu problemu niskiej wydajności jest poznanie natury &ndash; i ceny &ndash; towarzyszącej językom dynamicznym. Weźmy pod uwagę następujący przykład: załóżmy, że stworzyliśmy klasę w dowolnym języku statycznie typowanym (np. Java lub C#). Jej postać jest następująca:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c#'><span class='line'><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nie zagłębiając się zanadto w szczegóły jesteśmy w stanie stwierdzić, że wywołanie konstruktora powinno zaowocować stworzeniem w pamięci obiektu zajmującego 8 bajtów (2*sizeof(int)). Jak to wygląda w językach dynamicznie typowanych? Otóż w Rubym MRI, Pythonie oraz JavaScriptcie (w niektórych przypadkach) tworzony obiekt jest de facto nie zwykłym blokiem pamięci lecz strukturą budową bardziej przypominającą hash mapę/słownik, w którym każde pola reprezentowane jest przez string (js), hash (py) lub symbol reprezentowany w globalnej tablicy symboli (rb). Dotyczy to każdego pojedynczego obiektu. Wynika to w naturalny sposób z faktu, że tworząc obiekt danego typu, możemy go w dowolnej chwili rozszerzyć o nowe pola bez zmiany struktury obiektów o tej samej klasie. Czas dostępu do pól w takich obiektach jest bardzo duży, zaś same struktury są o wiele większe niż ich odpowiedniki w językach statycznie typowanych.</p>

<p>Czy da się to ominąć? Tak, rozwiązanie zostało już wynalezione i zaimplementowane w JavaScriptcie na silnikach V8 (Chrome) oraz najnowszym SquirrelFish (Safari). Oba te silniki definiują tzw. <em>hidden classes</em>. Idea która za nimi stoi wynika z prostej przesłanki. Otóż zauważono, że nawet w językach dynamicznych wewnętrzna struktura obiektów przez znaczną większość czasu pozostaje taka sama. Z tego powodu możemy reprezentować obiekty o tej samej budowie przez ukrytą klasę &ndash; jej struktura pamięci jest identyczna z tą w językach statycznie typowanych. W momencie kiedy rozszerzamy dany obiekt o kolejne pola, tworzymy dla niego kolejną ukrytą klasę, o nowej, rozrośniętej budowie, a następnie realokujemy do nowej postaci. Z punktu widzenia wykonywanego programu jest to dość rzadkie zjawisko, natomiast korzyści płynące z tego podejścia są ogromne.</p>

<h2>JIT, Interpreter oraz Tracing</h2>

<p>Ostatnia różnica, na której chcę się skupić dotyczy różnic wynikających z kompilatorów JIT (używanych obecnie niemal we wszystkich najpopularniejszych językach: Javie, C# czy Pythonie na silniku PyPy) w stosunku do tradycyjnych interpreterów (Ruby MRI) oraz możliwości jakich dostarczają.</p>

<p>Podstawowa różnica między tymi dwoma typami polega na tym, że tradycyjny interpreter przetwarza i generuje kod maszynowy na bieżąco w czasie rzeczywistym, interpretując skrypt linijka po linijce. JIT w tym czasie wykonuje małe wyprzedzenie, przetwarzając cały dostępny kod jeszcze przed punktem jego wykonania.</p>

<p>Dodatkową korzyścią płynącą z podejścia kompilacji JIT jest możliwość dynamicznej optymalizacji kodu w trakcie jego działania. Takie podejście stosowane jest przez wszystkie najnowsze maszyny wirtualne. Jedna z takich technik znana jest jako <strong>trace trees</strong> i została opisana <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~franz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-06-16.pdf">tutaj</a>. W dużym skrócie ideą tego podejścia jest wyłapanie w aplikacji powtarzających się fragmentów kodu oraz zoptymalizowanie ich w taki sposób, aby wykonywały one jak najmniej instrukcji procesora. W jaki sposób jest to osiągane?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inlining </strong>&ndash; a więc ograniczenie liczby instrukcji call do zewnętrznych funkcji poprzez skopiowanie ich zawartości do wnętrza pętli.</li>
<li><strong>Wnioskowanie typów</strong> &ndash; przykład: jeżeli w języku dynamicznym dodajemy do siebie w pętli dwie&nbsp;wartości typu int&nbsp;1000 razy, mamy przesłanki aby twierdzić, że operacje wykonane na tej zmiennej zawsze będą dotyczyć obiektu tego samego typu (gdyby nie to, musielibyśmy za każym razem sprawdzać czy operator dodawania nie został np. użyty raz dla <strong>int</strong>ów a inny raz dla <strong>string</strong>ów). Takie wnioski umożliwią nam wygenerowanie kodu maszynowego zoptymalizowanego do tego konkretnego typu &ndash; jest to bardzo przydatne z punktu widzenia Ruby&#8217;ego. Za przykład niech posłuży metoda dodawania 2 liczb całkowitych &ndash; teoretycznie możliwa do wykonania w 1 instrukcji maszynowej, w Rubym jest opakowana w metodę wirtualną, która dodatkowo definiuje sprawdzanie zakresu dla wynikowej liczby i w zależności od wyniku zwraca jedną z dwóch wewnętrznie różnych implementacji obiektu opakowującego dany wynik</li>
<li><strong>Rekonstrukcja do postaci kodu maszynowego wykonywalnego na GPU</strong> &ndash; wykonywalne, o ile kompilator jest w stanie rozpoznać stosowny kod na podstawie określonych wzorców (z tego co wiem, maszyna wirtualna na FireFoxie potrafi coś takiego).</li>
</ul>


<p>Rozwiązania zostały już wykorzystane na najnowszych VMach JavaScriptu. Niestety Ruby i Python wciąż czekają na swoją kolej.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>O tym czym jest Git, wie chyba każdy programista. O konwencjach i wzorcach stosowanych podczas produkcji do rozwoju repozytorium słyszało jednak zdecydowanie mniej osób, zaś jeszcze mniej stosowało je w praktyce. W tym poście postaram się poruszyć ten temat w kontekście <strong>git flow</strong> &ndash; narzędzia do integracji systemu kontroli wersji ze strategią procesu tworzenia oprogramowania.</p>

<p>Jakiś czas temu Maciej Aniserowicz <a href="http://www.maciejaniserowicz.com/2012/12/10/sztuka-commitowania-pracy/">opisał na swoim blogu</a> kilka własnych przemyśleń na temat konwencji stosowanych w celu poprawy pracy z systemem kontroli wersji. Mniej więcej wtedy zaczął mi świtać pomysł podzielenia się swoimi spostrzeżeniami na temat git flow &ndash; narzędzia, które miałem okazję poznać wcześniej podczas moich przygód jako programisty RoR. Teraz po długich miesiącach nareszcie zebrałem się w sobie aby podzielić się swoimi doświadczeniami.</p>

<h2>Czym jest git flow?</h2>

<p>W skrócie jest to nakładka do gita rozszerzająca go o zbiór nowych komend umożliwiających nadanie temu systemowi kontroli wersji struktury zgodniej z workflowem wytwarzania oprogramowania. Pytanie: tylko jak wygląda ten workflow? Jego głównym założeniem jest podział repozytorium na kilka ściśle powiązanych ze sobą płaszczyzn-gałęzi:</p>

<ul>
<li>gałąź developerska (domyślnie: <em>develop</em>) &ndash; na niej nanoszone są bieżące zmiany commitowane przez programistów pomiędzy wypuszczaniem kolejnych wersji programu.</li>
<li>gałąź produkcyjna (domyślnie: <em>master</em>) &ndash; zawiera bieżącą, najnowszą wersję programu.</li>
<li>gałęzie z wersjami (domyślnie: <em>release-&lt;numer_wersji></em>) &ndash; po jednej na każdą wydaną wersję programu. Zmiany stąd trafiają później bezpośrednio na gałąź produkcyjną.</li>
<li>gałęzie z nowymi funkcjonalnościami (domyślnie: <em>feature-<nazwa></em>) &ndash; za każdym razem kiedy tworzymy nowy moduł/funkcjonalność do projektu, tworzymy dla niego automatycznie jego własną gałąź. Po zakończeniu prac jest ona mergowana z branchem developerskim.</li>
<li>gałęzie z poprawkami (domyślnie: <em>hotfix-<nazwa></em>) &ndash; poprawki mogą być wykonywane zarówno z gałęzi produkcyjnej jak i developerskiej i tworzone są dla nich własne odnogi. Po zacommitowaniu poprawki trafia ona do obu branchów (<em>master </em>oraz <em>develop</em>).</li>
<li>gałęzie wsparcia (domyślnie: <em>support-&lt;numer_wersji></em>) &ndash; wprowadzona niedawno. Tutaj wykonywane są poprawki i zmiany na potrzeby klientów wykorzystujących starsze wersje programu.</li>
</ul>


<p>Całość została dokładniej &ndash; wraz z przykładami &ndash; przedstawiona <a href="http://vimeo.com/16018419">tutaj</a>. Na oficjalnym wiki projektu na githubie można z kolei znaleźć <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments">pełną listę nowych komend</a>. Pozwalają one zautomatyzować proces zarządzania commitami/zadaniami na każdej z gałęzi.</p>

<h2>Jak zainstalować git flow na Windows?</h2>

<p>Jest to w sumie dobre pytanie, ponieważ domyślnie narzędzie to było tworzone na potrzeby społeczności Linuxa. Instalacja na systemie Windows jest odrobinę bardziej skomplikowana, jednak w Internecie dostępne są poradniki poruszające to zagadnienie &ndash; ja korzystałem z <a href="http://xinyustudio.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/installing-git-flow-in-windows/">tego</a> (z niewielkimi zmianami). Poniżej opiszę listę kroków jaką wykonałem, aby rozruszać git flow u siebie.</p>

<p>Zakładając, że mamy już zainstalowanego Gita i znamy ścieżkę do niego, należy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pobrać <em>util-linux-ng</em> dla Windowsa. Można to zrobić z <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/util-linux-ng.htm">tej strony</a>. Wystarczy jednak, że z działu Downloads pobierzemy tylko foldery <strong>Bin </strong>oraz <strong>Dependencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Skopiować zawartość paczki <strong>Bin/bin</strong><strong> </strong>oraz <strong>Dependecies/bin/libintl3.dll</strong> do katalogu bin w ścieżce, w której mamy zainstalowanego Gita.</li>
<li>Klonujemy repozytorium git flowa: <code>git clone –-recursive git://github.com/nvie/gitflow.git</code></li>
<li>Na koniec musimy w zwykłej systemowej konsoli wejść do nowo sklonowanego folderu <strong>gitflow/contrib</strong> i wywołać komendę: <code>msysgit-install.cmd &ldquo;&lt;ścieżka do Gita>&rdquo;</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Po wykonaniu tych kroków wszystkie komendy git flowa powinny być dostępne.</p>

<h2>Bonus dla ciekawskich</h2>

<p>Dla części z czytelników może być to nowość, ale git umożliwia nam definiowanie własnych komend. Aby to wykonać, należy utworzyć własny plik .exe, który będzie definiował naszą komendę. Nazwa pliku jednocześnie określa jego sposób wywołania, przkładowo plik <em>git-&lt;moja_komenda>.exe</em> będzie można wywołać za pomocą polecenia <code>git &lt;moja_komenda></code>. Zgodnie z przyjętą zasadą konstrukcji skryptów bashowych pierwsza linijka pliku powinna zawierać polecenie <code>#!/bin/sh</code>. Kolejne linie definiują polecenia, które chcemy zawrzeć. Na koniec, aby plik był widziany z poziomu konsoli gita, należy go umieścić w ścieżce <em>&lt;katalog_git>/libexec/git-core</em> &ndash; tam też możemy zobaczyć definicje wszystkich dotychczas dostępnych komend.</p>
